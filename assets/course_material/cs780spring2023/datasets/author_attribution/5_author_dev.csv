he mentioned the street and number where i had made my temporary home with my young bride before he finished this doctor had said enough to convince me that my wife had given birth to a living child the next morning as you may imagine i was on the train that would take me nearest to the town where had resided love at seventy there i learned that some months after the death of her sister she had adopted as she claimed a child found in an asylum but which i have proved she brought from new york the clergyman has retired from the but by the description i gave of him he was easily identified and i have communicated with him listened without interruption and when his uncle finished he asked have you found your child yet no was the sad reply but i shall move heave and earth until it is

been allowed to remain long mrs would have viewed the affair with her frown had it come to her attention on general principles the usually old lady would have been right for this once but with such a good young man as such a of innocence as and such a very wise young maiden as all was sure to go properly was certain that if she could only get an interview with mr and tell him she would no longer

morning with do they laugh at and ashore to the has chief of the caught them with in the s garden or have they made cheese cakes without friends of my youth where in your wanderings have you tasted the that you neither come nor send us tidings across the sea also came idle as false reports steal into history and fair was it longer ago than yesterday that i walked with my cousin then recently a widow and talked with her of the countries to which she meant to sail she was young and dark eyed and wore great of gold gold in her ears the hope of italy the thought of living there had risen like a dawn in the darkness of her mind i talked and listened by rapid turns was it longer ago than yesterday that she told me of her splendid plans how palaces with gorgeous paintings should be hired and the best of teachers lead her children to the and most various knowledge how â and with her slender â she should have a box at the opera and a carriage and servants and in perfect loo health and youth lead a perfect life in a perfect climate and now what do i hear why does a tear sometimes drop so audibly upon my paper that looks across with a sort of mild glance of inquiry whether it is kind to let even a single tear fall when an ocean of tears is pent up in hearts that would burst and if but one drop should force its way out why across the sea came faint stories like low voices in the wind of a garden and sunny seclusion and a life of unknown and luxury what is this picture of a pale face with streaming black hair and large sad eyes looking upon lovely and noble children playing in the sunshine and a brow pained with thought straining into their destiny who is this figure a man tall and comely with melting eyes and graceful motion who comes and goes at pleasure who is not a husband yet has the key of the garden i do not know they are secrets of the sea the pictures pass before my mind suddenly and unawares and i feel the tears rising that i would gladly repress looks at me then stands by the window of the office and his brow against the cold iron bars and looks down into the little square paved court i take my hat and steal out of the office for a few minutes and slowly pace the hurrying streets magnificent sweet baby why does the sea you so far away when will you return where do you linger the water idly about the â lies calm or why does it bring me doubts and fears now that brought such of beauty in the days long gone i remember that the day when my cousin with of gold in her ears sailed for italy was quarter day and we balanced the books at the office it was nearly noon and in my impatience to be away i had not added my columns with sufficient care the inexorable hand of the office clock pointed sternly towards twelve and the ed solemnly to noon v to a man whose pleasures are not many and rather small the loss of such an event as saying farewell and wishing to a friend going to europe is a great loss it was so to me especially because there was always more to me in every departure i than the parting and the farewell i was gradually this pleasure as i saw small prospect of ending before noon when after looking at me a moment came to my side of the desk and said i should like to finish that for you i looked at him poor he had no friends to wish upon any journey i quietly wiped my pen took down my hat and went out it was in the days of sail and less regularity when going to europe was more of an epoch in life how my cousin stood upon the deck and detailed to me he plan how merrily the children shouted and sang how long i held my cousin s little hand in j f mine and gazed into her great eyes remembering that they would see and touch the things that were invisible to me forever but all the more precious and fair she kissed me â was younger then â there were tears i remember and prayers and promises a waving a fading sail it was only the other day that i saw another parting of the same kind i was not a principal only a spectator but so fond am i of sharing afar off as it were and unseen the sympathies of human beings that i cannot avoid often going to the dock upon steamer days and giving myself to that pleasant and melancholy observation there is always a crowd but this day it was almost impossible to advance through the masses of people the eager faces hurried by a constant stream poured up the into the steamer and the upper deck to which i gradually made my way was crowded with the passengers and their friends there was one group upon which my eyes first fell and upon which my memory a glance brilliant as daybreak

against poor mr apparently on the ground that he was a natural and eminent enemy of their family though what he had done to deserve this treatment did not in the least appear it was a sight to witness

bear but one i love is being deceived in the most cruel manner and there is nothing i dare do to aid her she studied the statement for some seconds and then asked him to explain what good will it do he demanded no one the bearer of evil tidings supposing i should their marriage bond tell a woman that her husband was a robber and a murderer she might leave him but she would always associate me with her injury a robber and a murderer that certainly could not refer to i never could understand said with a that made her look why don t you speak out plainly if you know anything that you ought to tell me fear nothing i hope i am sensible enough not to connect a friend who brings unpleasant news with the news itself he regarded her so intently that she flushed before his gaze shall i he asked i ought to tell you but is it wise he took a from the pocket of his coat and held it thoughtfully in his hands then he slowly it and exhibited two pieces of glass on which fragments of a torn letter were in such a manner that both sides could be easily read no he exclaimed as if strongly moved it is better that you do not read it had seen at a glance that the writing was that of her husband and her curiosity was aroused to the utmost as mr had expected she sprang to his and endeavored to take the article from him while he was in the pretended act of returning it to his pocket there was a pretty little struggle and then as if out of pure gallantry he surrendered and the panes of glass were in her hands it is cruel he said with well emotion i cannot justify myself for letting you see this but after all the fault is his i will resist no more lay it their marriage bond on the table and see what your friend and mine is capable of doing with shaking fingers she did as suggested mr

you sure sir quite sure i have long seen reason to suspect it so last night i went through all the books and now i am sure whoever the villain is i will send him to prison if i can catch him and turned his head away in his mind whether he should affect indignation and sympathy and pretend to court inquiry or should wait till and then empty the cash box and bolt whilst thus these words fell unexpectedly on his ear and you must help me then s eyes turned this way and that in a manner that is common among thieves and a smile curled his pale thin lip it is my duty said the sly rogue then after a pause but how then mr glanced at ton in the and not satisfied with speaking under his breath drew this ill chosen to the other end of the office why suspect everybody and watch them now there

been brushing his hair and his whiskers a tall stiff military figure literally marched into the middle of the office and there stood like a mr could hardly believe his senses colonel i said he roughly

this is a very private matter took the hint and asked to retire into the inner office as soon as he and colonel were alone that warrior still standing straight as a dart delivered himself of certain short sentences each of which seemed to be or indeed jerked out of him by some foreign power seated in his breast my sister your injured wife is no more dead this is very sudden i am very very sorry i

moment turned away to s private table and there emptied his pockets of certain documents one of which he wanted to select his back was not turned more than half a minute yet a most expressive took place in that short interval the nurse opened a door of communication and stood with a rush at the threshold indeed she would have rushed in but for the stranger she was very pale and threw up her hands to her face and her gesture were more expressive than words then clinging by mere desperate instinct to money he could not hope to keep flew to her drove her out by a movement of both hands though he did not touch her and spread himself before the door with his face and eyes turned toward colonel the colonel turned and stepped toward him with the document he had selected at the table

ture the problem few earnest of literature have escaped those black moments when it seems perfectly evident that the one thing sure in connection with the whole business is that literature cannot be taught if they are of sensitive conscience they are likely to have wondered at times whether it is honest to go on pretending to give instruction in a branch in which instruction was so obviously the more they consider the more evident it is that if a pupil really anything in literature â aa distinguished from learning about literature â he does it himself and they cannot fail to see that as an art literature necessarily of the nature of all art the quality of being and j in any language except its own the root of whatever exists in the of modern courses of training which have to do with literature is just this fact any art as has been said often and often exists simply and solely because it and what can be expressed in no i talks on teaching literature other form a picture or a melody a statue or a poem gives delight and inspiration by which could belong to nothing to â painting or or e is at best to talk about these words cannot express wliat the work or art expresses or the work itself would be superfluous and the teacher of literature la s therefore apparently confronted with the task of to impart what language itself cannot so stated the proposition seems self contradictory and absurd indeed it too often happens that in actual practice it is so teachers weary their very souls in necessarily fruitless to achieve the impossible and fail in their work because they have not clearly apprehended what they could effect and what they should endeavor to effect in any instruction it is of great importance to recognize natural and and nowhere is this more true than in any teaching which has to do with the fine arts in other branches failure to perceive the natural of the subject limits the of the teacher in the arts it not only utterly all work hut it gives students a wrong conception of the very nature of that with which they are dealing in most studies the teacher has to do chiefly with the understanding or to put it more exactly with the intellect of the pupil in dealing with literature he reckon constantly with the also if he arouse the feelings and the problem the of his students he does not succeed in his work not only is this difficult in itself but it calls for aa condition in the which is not easily with the mood required by teaching a condition moreover which a to results much more keen than any disappointment likely to be excited by failure to carry a class triumphantly through a lesson in or history this constantly brings and this in to renewed failure in work which s requires the happiest mood on the part of the teacher and tho play of the imagination the consciousness of any lack of success the a the teacher who is able by sheer force of determination to manage the of a dull a class may fail in the attempt to make the same force carry him through an exercise in it is true that no teaching is unless the interest as well as the attention of the pupils is but whereas in other branches this is a condition in the case of literature it is a prime essential the teaching of literature moreover ia less than useless if it is not as distinguished from it is greatly to be regretted that necessity the holding of at all in a subject of which the worth is to be measured strictly by the extent to which it the imagination and the talks on teaching literature ter of the student any system of is likely to be at best a made inevitable by existing conditions and it is rendered tolerable only where teachers â often at the expense imder present school methods of a stress of body and of soul to be appreciated only by those who have taught â are able to mingle a certain amount of education with the grinding of routine examination papers hardly touch and can hardly show the results of literary training which are the only excuse for the presence of this branch in the school every faithful who is trying to do is best for the children while the of the official powers above him is face to face with the fact that the returns of and do not in the least represent his best or most laboriously achieved success under these conditions it is not strange that so many teachers are at a loss to know what they are expected to do or what they should attempt to do if the teachers in the secondary schools of this country were brought together into some palace of truth where absolute honesty was forced upon them it would be interesting and perhaps to find how few could confidently assert that ji they have clear and logical ideas in regard to the teaching of literature they would all be able to say that they dealt with certain books because such work is a prominent part of the school and many would unless restrained by the problem the truth compelling power of their add vague phrases about the minds of the a pitiful number would be forced to confess that they had no clear conception of what they were to do beyond up the memories of the young folk with certain dead information about books to be at the next and there left too often broad f the mind of the young is simple it out by the dead weight of lifeless and worthless this uncertainty in regard to what are to do and how tliey are to do it is constantly

old maids have the best children it must seem quite ridiculous to hear a bachelor over the delights of constant association between husband and wife but my theories are harmless ones or will be if they don t bore you too much i am not single from conviction that it is the best state in which to live but merely because the woman whom i could love as i think a wife should be loved never came across my path when i do marry if you chance to know a husband s me then i will show you a pattern of devotion i met once out in africa an english nobleman who was returning with his wife from a tour of hundreds of miles through the heart of that savage country she had been with him for three years where no white woman had ever gone before dressed for convenience in a semi masculine costume carrying a gun and riding a horse with as much ease as any man in the party the husband told me that he had got ready to go on this journey without her and went to bid her good by when they both discovered that they simply could not endure it it was impossible to give up the expedition and there was nothing for the wife to do but pack a hand bag and go along she took a comb and brush and a little mirror of course and just as few other things as was possible for three years she had been he told me not only no to him in those but a real pleasure and assistance i almost envied that couple i assure you if i could find a woman like that i might give up my own condition of single he laughed at this in a way that was quite and she could not help smiling a little it was easier for her to listen to this man than to talk to him he thought it best to leave the subject where it was and accordingly began to discuss the paris book which he took up and opened by questioning he found that she had read most of it and that it interested her i have never read many books she said simply but i mean to now the children are less care than they were and i shall have more time may i send for some of mine and lend them to you he asked i have rows and why do you visit ut rows of them in new york doing no good to anybody you are kind to offer it she replied a but i prefer to buy my books and keep them i n r ould like you to give me a little list of some that think i would need though if it would not be too much on the contrary he said quickly i shall be delighted what will you have have you any choice among the poets history that is always interesting novels books of travel and adventure you see there are so many books one never reads half of them i will write you a list just a few that i think you will like though very likely there will be some that you have already you need not be afraid that you will include many that i have read she admitted i have never cared much for books but now i want them yes she repeated i want a good many of them i mean to read much and your advice will be of great value before he went away that evening he led her into a discussion regarding and its surroundings and she gave him much information regarding the place and people talking on a subject with which she was familiar her countenance threw off its partially constrained expression and she grew animated i suppose you have relatives here he said he had finished laughing at one of her descriptions only two she replied growing suddenly sober an unmarried brother and sister of my father they are quite old fashioned people my never goes anywhere and my aunt took offence at mv marriage and now she never calls husband s friend either i might almost say i have no relations in at all it did not seem strange to her that she told him this she had known him nearly two weeks and was over again after that night he called often there was nothing else in that interested him spite of the little with which he met the few inhabitants with whom he had occasion to discuss its beauties of scenery he yawned away the mornings over newspapers and the latest light literature he disposed of the afternoon either at the table when he could find any one to play with or exploring the country roads when he could not he did not mean to call on mrs every evening but he usually managed to see her at some hour in the twenty four he attended every local affair that was worth going to and many that were not and it happened curiously that she always knew he would be there and managed to be present herself a local band gave monday and wednesday evenings on the common there was a praise meeting friday night he had not quite got himself up to the point where he attended the saturday evening prayer meeting but he rather liked the singing especially since he found that s voice was one of those he would hear there were several sunday school and society at lake grove in which he developed an astonishing interest and she was usually on the committee of arrangements sunday there was the sermon of course which he never missed he could sit in mr s and see her for an hour on and he was pretty sure to drop in after supper and many other times h why do you ,1,Arthur Conan Doyle

there was worse in store for him the curtains were drawn right and left with power and there stood grace beautiful but pale and terrible she marched toward him with eyes that rooted him to the spot

his devilish eyebrows and bis restless eyes this is the man that that wretch to the mine these last words ringing from her lips like the trumpet of doom were answered as swiftly as at a lighted torch by a furious yell and in a moment the room seemed a forest of wild beasts a score of raging came upon him from every side dragging tearing beating kicking cursing yelling he was down in a moment then soon up again then dragged out of the room nails fists and heavy boots all going stripped to the shirt screaming like a woman a dozen rolled down the steps with him in the midst of them he got clear

chapter strange turns and yet this catastrophe rose out of a mistake when the asked to watch the lawn he never suspected that the clergyman was the villain who had been concerned in that explosion but a man of few ideas and full of his own wrong took for granted as such minds will that the policeman would not have spoken to him if this had not been his affair so he and his fellows gathered about the steps and watched the drawing room they caught a glimpse of bat that only puzzled them his appearance was inconsistent with the only description they had got â in fact opposed to it it was grace s trumpet that let loose savage justice on the villain never was a woman s voice so fatal or so swift to she would have undone her work she screamed she implored but it was all in vain the fury she had launched she could not recall as for words can hardly describe his abject terror he crouched he shivered he moaned he almost and long after it was all over he was found crouched in a corner of the

i could with my but she won t the banner and in her tent i am afraid that i have exhausted all my power in her to join me as my future wife said the squire politely nodded her approval s a nice girl

hotel to see the name george written in a bold hand he immediately sought out the landlord and called his attention to the signature i do not want that man to know that i am here he said you may send my meals to my room until further notice as he turned around he found at his elbow and knew that every word he had uttered must have been heard by him but he was not in the least disconcerted

since that evening when he and had talked so long together after leaving s house so marked was the change in his that miss could not help noticing it and it very impressed her she treated him with more cordiality than before and raised his hopes so high that he restrained himself with difficulty from a too of his love but still between him and the object he had in view always arose like a he heard a good deal about him from miss and others and whispers that he was soon expected home began to trouble him seriously it was hardly possible tc maintain the serenity of expression upon which he had resolved the question whether was already married was often and determined to settle it if he could it was not advisable to make too many inquiries of the circle at miss s and for some time he

later showed that the words last quoted were missing which convinced that they had been omitted either by special request or on account of husband s friend change in residence at any rate it was an easy thing to go to and make somebody there would be sure to know the family and in case they had moved away the would undoubtedly have the new address the question of wife and children could be solved much easier where the lived than in boston as there was but one hotel in could not very well avoid running across about the first thing he did neither of the men was glad to see the other there for each felt that his movements would now have to be to some extent suspected from the first the real nature of s errand and saw that it was likely to interfere with his visits to mrs he could not however have imagined the extent to which the lover would go in his desire to remove from his path he could not foresee that he would make the acquaintance of miss and pour into her too willing ear under the promise to conceal the name of her all that he knew pr guessed about s visits to miss thought at first of telling him the truth hoping that it would his stay but in order to do this it might be necessary to explain some things about which he did not care to be in this way several weeks went by during which the two men became a constant nuisance to each other they had to pretend friendship when they met and they played a game of together once in a while but neither was in the least deceived soon found out what he came to learn and had the additional satisfaction of getting aunt to help him in his work he might have left husband you know town then except for his wish to watch whose presence there troubled him not a little he went to boston each saturday not liking to miss seeing the object of his adoration on sunday evening but he always returned on the monday morning train had it not been for this brief might have had the unpleasant experience of living in that dull village week after week without even speaking to the woman whose presence chained him there when she asked him why he did not call oftener he made replies which caused her no little distress he had always seemed so frank about everything that the least symptom of hesitation gave her much uneasiness she assigned every reason but the right one to his changed manner and the situation grew very unpleasant for them both miss was not as may be imagined willing to leave in ignorance of what she had learned when declined to do anything but wait until her husband came home her aunt paid an immediate visit to the office of the village lawyer mr and directed him to draw up without delay a new will for her brother the lawyer knew the well enough to be sure that would sign anything that his sister told him to and readily promised to set about the work at once he was rather than usual that week however and miss got quite uneasy has said anything more to you about the new will she asked her brother when nearly had gone by only that he s very busy and is going to write it as soon as he can how long did he think we were to wait husband s for him snapped the woman her black eyes you tell him to morrow that if he doesn t get it done this week i shall go over to yes if anything should happen to you continued miss every penny of our money would go t those after i am through with it i ,1,Arthur Conan

would be to wash the dark spots from her mind and conscience for had a conscience one that burned and pricked her whenever she its and at this moment it rang a in her ears which seemed as if it would

stooped to make use of such a tool when the result must inevitably be to place her under obligations no end of annoyance she heartily wished as she sat there that she had not been so there had not been time to consider the opportunity had come so top children also that she could not resist the temptation she could write to him or telegraph him even now at bidding him do nothing about it but

at peace and amongst others an treaty had been entered into between france and england at first it related to general works of literature but it was afterwards applied to dramatic this action was founded on the last act of parliament on this subject which was passed in the year of the present reign entitled an act to enable her majesty to carry effect a with france on the subject of and to extend and explain the act in that act there were the words the th section which the following important provision â that the eighth nothing contained shall be so as to prevent a fair imitation or to the english stage of any dramatic piece or musical composition of any foreign country so that the right was preserved to dramatic authors in this country if they should think proper to or imitate any dramatic piece which might have been composed or written in france and then it carried the right to the profits that are from the authors having so exercised their talent the present action was founded on that provision in the act of parliament the were both of them actors and dramatic authors there appeared in the course of the present year in paris a dramatic piece which became exceedingly popular and attracted a deal of attention it was les de paris the got that piece and having read it they were required to prepare a dramatic piece upon the same foundation called the of poverty or the seal poor of london and what the jury would have to consider was whether that was a fair imitation or to the english stage of the dramatic piece published in called les de paris having composed that piece as a fair or imitation of that which was so successful in paris they offered it for the acceptance of and mr of the strand theatre accepted the piece and it was produced on the th of february in the present year on saturday the th of the same month mr went to the strand theatre and there performed certainly a strange and entirely new character for mr he believed was an author himself he served upon the manager a notice of his intention to make an application to the court of for an and that notice to be signed by mr who was a respectable attorney in s inn fields besides that he had caused an advertisement to appear in the era a newspaper very well known as the organ of the theatrical profession it being and that advertisement was the principal object of complaint in the present action the advertisement was as follows mr chambers then read my advertisement the judge chief baron of the asked for a copy of the era it which was handed up to him mr chambers resumed â that notice was served on the saturday and to be signed by mr mr james â that was a mistake which we shall explain presently mr chambers â the natural effect of that was somewhat to alarm mr and more to alarm a more race the the eighth on the stage became dreadfully at the threat of an and it was only after the greatest possible persuasion that they were induced to on the stage having the fear before their eyes of the of the lord who might come to carry them off to the court of the result was to throw a great damp on the success of the piece and the exertions of the actors another natural effect of that notice was that other were prevented from in the speculation as they might have been involved in the proceedings in the jury were aware that the authors of dramatic pieces in country under another act of parliament brought in by a lamented author and the late mr justice were entitled by virtue of their to receive from all throughout the country a sum every night that their pieces were played mr s advertisement of course prevented that profit reaching the upon mr communicating with mr whose name was attached to the notice that gentleman at once said that his name had been so attached without his authority and that no application to was intended to be made thereupon mr wrote the following letter to the era the chief baron â what copy of the era is that mr chambers â the st of march and the letter was as follows here my letter was read and the chief baron examined it in the paper mr chambers resumed â true it would be seen ho did not intend to injure mr but i he the lord chief baron suggested the best course would have been to refer the two pieces to an to settle whether there was a fair imitation mr chambers could not to that course this was a case of of title the lord chief

me to conduct the services over her remains i would like to hear any suggestions you wish to make in reference to the matter mrs drew was sitting in the room with the the was too great gentlemen but was absent at the moment moved uneasily in his chair let me tell you then to begin with said he that your services must be very brief and simple there is to be no of family affairs either by allusion or you may read the burial service if you wish and have a hymn sung but that is all mr s eyes dilated he had supposed that at this stage he would be allowed to have his own way much as a does at an he had known many who in the presence of the and permitted a funeral that irritated them merely because they had not the nerve to dictate to the contrary before his astonishment permitted him to frame a reply spoke again another thing he said there will be no persons present except my own small circle of intimate friends and the servants of the house that body upstairs is not to be before the eyes of the public you will be allowed ten minutes to finish your and prayers and if there is the remotest reference to the husband the affair will be cut short i know the tricks you are capable of sir and i warn you i will have none of them mrs drew murmured george as if to remind him of the solemnity of the subject but he would not heed her i am not going to tell the story of my from that lady to you he went on looking straight at the clergyman i will say however that we have not been husband and wife except in out of name for sixteen years although there have been times when i held hard feelings toward her f believe upon my soul all is over now i simply desire to have none of those things which our circumstances would make ridiculous promise what i ask and i shall have nothing more to say mr replied that it would be a great disappointment to the members of his congregation who had a very high regard for sister and who had hoped the services would be held in his church he also had prepared a brief tribute to her womanly virtues and christian fortitude in the midst of her sufferings and it seemed to him i know i know interrupted i understand all that but you can t do it the only question is will you come here and perform the service i suggest or shall i send for another minister with several and the clergyman finally gave the requisite promise though sorely disappointed he had intended to give the husband some very neat before a large and audience on the day of the funeral he kept reasonably close to his agreement though one or two allusions to his hope that this occasion would prove a blessing to those still without the of religion on s nervous ears the conduct of was noticeable she sat by the side of her father listening to all that was said and watching all that was done with the quiet well bred air of a well trained girl of her age on the way to the she held one of his hands in hers but neither of them uttered a word the was too great shuddered a little as the were thrown on the coffin but there were no tears from either father or daughter though mrs drew and who come and mrs and the servants wept when the party returned to the house felt its that void which the dead always leave in the where they have been known she had grown older in the week that was past she could no longer be spoken of as a child of the household noticed it she gave directions and suggested things and assumed control of the premises as she had never done before and all the time she was thinking thinking thinking the only thing that was left in her conduct that reminded us of the little girl we had known was the love for her it was a wonder to see her after giving orders about the house that took breath away sit down to her work basket and on a new dress or a set of for one of her charges she took her hair that had hung in a and wound it in a knot at the back of her head she had her dresses let down several inches she looked and acted in everything but one three years older than she was but the found her the same careful mother that she had been when she first learned the use of needle and thread the neighbors children the very ones were also brought in as frequently if not more so than before the spectacle of a dozen of the mid gets on her nursery floor at once entertained in a fashion that delighted their young hearts was one that i saw many times during the next year in my calls at the house she never seemed so happy aa out of when surrounded with these one of them in her lap and the others in chorus about her feet one evening it was fully a year after mrs s funeral i happened to be spending an hour with my friends mrs drew was there and her husband and of course and was occupied with one of her children s parties in the manner above

or sleep on the pavement and the nights are rather too chilly for that mr laughed again as if his situation was the most amusing one of which he could co mr i can let you have a little replied gray with a blush as he drew out his slender purse and you will get the whole of it if you wait a year or so longer will will five dollars be of any use he asked fiery red as he thought of the difference between that sum and the one he had borrowed five dollars exclaimed why it s a fortune could you make it ten thank you i must be going he added as if haste was now the most important thing i ve just remembered a pressing engagement that i came near missing hardly stopping long enough to say good evening the man was gone and mr gray saw him spring upon a rapidly moving car going toward the centre of the city in the morning before left the house was back again he looked sleepless and haggard and was prepared with a rambling story to the effect that he had been met by and relieved of the sum mr gray was so kind as to lend him he was very tired and wanted above all things a chance to rest in that big house was there not some room no matter how high up or how poorly furnished that he could occupy till noon shrinking at first from the suggestion gray came at last to agree to it one reason was that he had no time for a refusal the bank being most particular as to the moment its s arrived he called the servant and bade her show the gentleman to a chamber on the second floor at the same time whispering that she must on no account let mrs gray know what she had done then he hastened away love gone to the scene of his labors not at all pleased with the situation but it came to pass that joseph secured a regular of that chamber like the of fable he put first his ears then his head and finally his whole body into the tent it remained to be seen whether in imitation of the ship of the desert he would kick the master out on the night of his arrival mr gray found that the englishman had not yet taken his departure he had been out part of the afternoon the servant said but had returned while the family were at dinner he went out again and did not come back until gray had gone to the bank the next morning the servant did not feel to refuse him entrance in the absence of instructions and he slept away the second day on the bed he had previously occupied the third day was sunday and when he came in after spending the entire night out of the house gray asked for an explanation this was made with tact business of great importance had detained him and he would be very glad if gray did not object to use the room for the few days he intended to remain in the city every moment he expected a him away and providing him with the necessary funds to g at the end of a week he was still there and having now obtained a key from the servant was quite at home as he used a side entrance which had been closed for some time he disturbed no one the spring days were rather chilly and he sent in wood and coal and built himself a fire it would certainly mb hare been to disturb a who conducted himself with such propriety especially when he was a of the other of the mansion to such a large extent but the week passed and a month and three months and still did not go his stories varied from time to time and yet hung together with remarkable he had now money in his pocket for he insisted upon the ten dollars he had borrowed and even offered to loan his benefactor a few hundred if he wanted it he almost insisted upon a price being put upon the rent of the room which he professed to like immensely and which he said he would not exchange for the best in s hotel when this was refused he said he should make a handsome allowance for it in the interest on his note whenever that was paid he still kept the most hours spending a good part of each day in bed and most of his nights abroad but as everything about him was peculiar this did not particularly astonish his new landlord sometimes he was gone for days without giving the slightest notice of his intentions when he returned it might be that his first act was to request the loan of enough to purchase a breakfast or on the other hand he came more than once with his pockets loaded with wealth certainly enough to flash a great roll of bank bills in the face of the servant who attended to his room and to present that lady with not less than twenty dollars at a time when in this condition ne always managed to meet mr gray and renew his proposals to pay rent or to love gone a y lend him a thousand or so whichever he preferred declined all of these offers however and said as little to his strange acquaintance as possible naturally learned that was in the house after awhile and asked anxiously for an explanation she remembered his face she said and did not like the memories it recalled told her as much as he chose of what had passed referring to the money by during the great wheat and not in any way to the more recent transaction while her father had had forty thousand dollars ,1,Arthur Conan Doyle
humor in every form as well as that of the honest wrath which shakes many a noble sentence of english as a mighty man of war is shaken by her own is something wholly apart from the and which are treated as if they were real forces itself as the easy chair has often said has a certain power and to call a man a rascal to a hundred thousand persons at once produces an effect but we must not mistake it for what it is not being false it is not an effect which nor does it vex the equal mind it is the fact that the public often seems to demand that kind of to enjoy fury instead of force and ridicule instead of reason which s the inquiry whether if self restraint and wise discipline are desirable for every faculty of the and body the tongue and hand alone should be allowed to riot in wanton excess if even the legitimate must be handled like with extreme caution of every degree is a nuisance to be and by those who know the difference between grandeur and between and between fair play and foul september newspaper vi the easy chair has been asked whether there is any code of newspaper manners it has no doubt that there is but it is the universal code of courtesy and not one to newspapers good manners in civilized society are the same everywhere and in all relations a newspaper is not a mystery it is the work of several men and women and their manners in doing the work are subject to the same principles that govern their manners in society or in any other human relation if a man is a gentleman he does not cease to be one because he enters a newspaper office and it would seem to be equally true that if his work on the paper does not prove to be that of a gentleman it could not have been a gentleman who did the work a gentleman we will suppose does not his neighbors nor talk incessantly about himself and his achievements nor behave elsewhere as he would be ashamed to behave in his club or in his own family if a gentle man does not do these things of course a gentleman does not do them in a newspaper and does it not seem to follow if such things are done in a newspaper and are traced to a hand supposed to be that of a gentleman that there has been some mistake about the hand good manners are essentially a disposition which conduct they can be feigned indeed as gilt gold and plate silver but the glass is not diamond a man may smile and smile and be a villain are sometimes described as of gentlemanly manners and newspaper was not personally a but he was not a gentleman and he merely affected good manners a gentleman indeed may sometimes lose his temper or his self control but no one who habitually does it and and rails can be called properly by that name here again it is easy to apply the to a newspaper when a newspaper habitually takes an insulting tone and deliberately whether by assertion of an or by a and of the truth it is not the work of a gentleman and if the writer be responsible for the tone of the paper the manners of that newspaper are not good manners but there is no in newspaper manners as there is none elsewhere therefore it cannot be said that newspapers as a whole are either well or as you cannot say that men as a body are courteous or uncouth some newspapers are vulgar like some people they are not so of themselves however they are made vulgar by vulgar people there are very able newspapers which have very bad manners and some which have no other distinction than good manners a very dull man may be very and so may a very dull newspaper on the other hand a newspaper which is both brilliant and clever may be sometimes guilty of an injustice a deliberate and persistent to attain a particular end â conduct which is sometimes called but the person who is responsible for the performance for similar conduct would be kicked out of a club but gentlemen are not kicked out of clubs a newspaper gains neither character newspaper nor influence by good manners it may indeed make itself disagreeable and and so silence opposition as a may effectually close the wood path which you had designed to take it may be feared and in the same way as that animal â feared and despised but this effect must not be confounded with newspaper power and influence it is exceedingly undoubtedly to be all over town as a liar or a donkey a or a thief but although the effect is most unpleasant very little ability is required to produce it a little paper and a little a great deal of malice and a host of are all that are needed and even the pecuniary cost is not large the effect is produced but it does not show ability or force or influence upon the part of its the manners of newspapers as such cannot be any more than the manners of or of the professions or trades this however seems to be true that a well man will not produce an ill newspaper april the end s other times and other seasons by a little english gallery by literary and social by studies of the stage by and with other essays on other by as

ship i tried to teach for i loved children but if anything excited a suspicion of my pupils and putting on my spectacles i saw that i was a snake or smelling at a bud with a worm in it i sprang up in horror and ran away or if it seemed to me through the glasses that a smiled upon me or a rose was blooming in my button hole then i felt myself imperfect and not fit to be leading and training what was so essentially superior to myself and i kissed the children and left them weeping and wondering in despair i went to a great merchant on the island and asked him to employ me my dear young friend said he i understand that you have some singular secret some charm or spell or or something i don t know what of which people are afraid now you know my dear said the merchant swelling up and apparently of his great stomach than of his large fortune i am not of that kind i am not easily frightened you may spare yourself the pain of trying to impose upon me i o people who propose to come to time before i arrive are accustomed to arise very early in the morning said he thrusting his in the of his waistcoat and spreading the fingers like two upon his bosom i think i have heard something of your secret you have a pair of spectacles i believe that you value very much because your grandmother brought them as a marriage portion to your grandfather now if you think to sell me those spectacles i will pay you the largest market price for them what do you say i told him had not the slightest idea of selling my spectacles my young friend means to eat them i suppose said he with a contemptuous smile i made no reply but was turning to leave the office when the merchant called after me my young friend poor people should never suffer themselves to get into anger is an expensive luxury in which only men of a certain income can indulge a pair of spectacles and a hot temper are not the most promising capital for success in life master i said nothing but put my hand upon the door to go out when the merchant said more respectfully well you foolish boy if you will not sell your spectacles perhaps you will agree to sell the use of them to me that is you shall only put them on when i direct you and for my purposes you little fool cried he impatiently as he saw that i intended to make no reply but i had pulled out my spectacles and put them on for my own purposes and against his wish and desire i looked at him and saw a huge bald headed wild with gross and a eye â only the more ridiculous for the high arched gold bowed spectacles that his nose one of his fore hoofs was thrust into the safe where his bills were and the other into his pocket among the loose change and bills there his ears were pricked forward with a brisk sensitive in a world where prize pork was the best excellence he would have carried off all the i stepped into the next office in the street and a mild faced genial man also a large and merchant asked me my business in such a tone that i instantly looked through my spectacles and saw a land flowing with milk and honey there i pitched my tent and stayed till the good man died and his business was but while there said and his voice trembled away into a sigh i first saw despite the spectacles i saw for days for weeks for months i did not take my spectacles with me i ran away from them i threw them up on high shelves i tried to make up my mind to throw them into the sea or down the well i could not i would not i dared not look at through the spectacles it was not possible for me deliberately to destroy them but i awoke in the night and could almost have cursed my dear old grandfather for his gift i sometimes escaped from the office and sat for whole days with i told her the strange things i had seen with my mystic glasses the hours were not enough for the wild which i in her ear she listened astonished and appalled her blue eyes turned upon me with sweet she clung to me and then withdrew and fled fearfully from the room but she could not stay away she could not resist my voice in whose tones burned all the love that filled my heart and brain the very effort to resist the desire of seeing her as i saw everybody else gave a frenzy and an unnatural to my feeling and my manner i sat by her side looking into her eyes her hair folding her to my heart which was sunken deep and deep â why not forever â in that dream of peace i ran from her presence and shouted and leaped with joy and sat the whole night through thrilled into happiness by the thought of her love and loveliness like a wind harp tightly strung and answering the sigh of the breeze with music then came calmer days â the conviction of deep love settled upon our lives â as after the hurrying heaving days of spring comes the bland and summer it is no dream then after all and we are happy i said to her one day and there came no answer for happiness is speechless we are happy then i said to myself there is no excitement now how glad i am that i can now look at her through my spectacles i feared lest some ,16,Rudyard Kipling

the wide yards of the vessel were stretched like elbows and even the sails were spread the was and and in the tops i saw what i supposed to be strings of or little round masses with but assured me they were sailors we rowed hard but came no nearer the vessel she is going with the tide and wind said i we shall never catch her my companion said nothing but why have they set the asked i she never takes in any sails answered the more fool she thought i a little impatiently angry at not getting nearer to the vessel but i did not say it aloud i would as soon have said it to as to the truth is i began to feel a little ill from the motion of the boat and remembered with a shade of regret and if wives could only keep their husbands a little ill i am confident they might be very sure of their constancy but somehow the strange ship was gained and i found myself among as singular a company as i have ever seen there were men of every country and of all kinds there was an indescribable in the air or a premature twilight in which all the figures looked ghostly and unreal the ship was of a model such as i had never seen and the had a so that i the whole craft like a ship s shop grown the figures glided rather than walked about and i perceived a strong smell of issuing from the hold but the most extraordinary thing of all was the sense of motion which possessed my mind the moment my struck the deck could have sworn we were dashing through the water at the rate of twenty knots an hour has a great but a little ignorant admiration of my knowledge of affairs and phrases i looked aloft and saw the sails with a stiff breeze and heard a faint whistling of the wind in the but very faint and rather it seemed to me as if it came from the of in the ships of or of quaint old craft upon the spanish main echoing through remote years â so far away it sounded yet i heard no orders given i saw no sailors running aloft and only one figure crouching over the wheel he was lost behind his great beard as behind a but the startling speed with which we along did not lift a solitary hair of that beard nor did the old and withered face of the pilot betray any curiosity or interest as to what or or pitiless shores might be lying in to destroy us still on we swept and as the traveller in a night train knows that he is passing green fields and pleasant gardens and winding streams fringed with flowers and is now gliding through or darting along the base of fearful cliffs so i was conscious that we were pressing through various and by romantic shores in vain i peered the gray twilight mist that folded all i could only see the vague figures that grew and faded upon the haze as my eye fell upon them like the characters of sympathetic ink when heat touches them now it was a belt of warm air in which we sailed and then cold as the breath of a ocean the perfume of new hay and the breath of roses came mingled with the distant music of bells and the song of birds and a low sound of the wind in summer woods there were all sounds of pastoral scenes of a tranquil landscape such as loves â and which shall be painted as the background of her portrait whenever she sits to any of my many artist friends â and that pastoral beauty shall be called england i x strained my eyes into the cruel mist that held all that music and all that suggested beauty but i could see nothing it was so sweet that i scarcely knew if i cared to see the very thought of it charmed my senses and satisfied my heart i and heard the landscape that i could not see then tlie penetrating fragrance of was across the air the richness of orange groves and the sacred of crushed such as is pressed from them when they are strewn upon the flat pavement of the streets of and gorgeous tread them incense filled the air i italy â as in the from s garden â and even while my heart leaped with the consciousness the passed and a stretch of burning silence succeeded it was an oppressive of heat â oppressive not only from its silence but from the sense of awful antique forms whether of art or nature that were sitting closely veiled in that mysterious obscurity i shuddered as i felt that if my eyes could pierce that mist or if it should lift and roll away i should see upon a silent shore low of lonely hills or mystic figures and huge temples trampled out of history by time this too we left there was a rustling of distant palms the indistinct roar of beasts and the hiss of then all was still again only at times the remote sigh of the weary sea moaning around desolate and the howl of winds that had

and your husband is simply paying a visit of ceremony to le cardinal he is devoted to my interests and once they make themselves known to him they are quite safe i should rather think that the first dangerous step submitted the duke with a smile not with cardinal he would be no prince of the church did he not exact in london obedience from his household not one of his servants would dare to betray his secrets they dread the law of the republic against but they dread the of the still more i thought that the of the were harmless now in the west they are in a great measure but here we move slowly and all our people are as faithfully devoted to the church as they were hundreds of years ago here the church is more than a name it is a power and one which i intend to use through cardinal will he submit to be an instrument asked doubtfully said the princess with great dignity it is not my desire to make use of his eminence merely as an instrument it is my firm conviction that to govern a kingdom the church and the should be in perfect the crown the needs of men it preserves the liberty of the country the of society on the other hand the church has supreme control of the minds of its children it can by them achieve results which can be arrived at by no other means church and state must therefore be to control the society over which they rule they should be one like a husband and wife for their interests are or should be cardinal is a servant of the church but he is also my subject and as such is bound in all honor to forward the interests of his sovereign villa where they do not clash with those of the church i have no wish to go contrary to the power of the x â replied coldly rather do i desire to use his influence as to the cardinal for the improvement of my country is the institution of most service to not cardinal has always seen that the interests of the and the are identical in au respects in two years he can scarcely have so much as to have thrown over his sovereign for a parcel of he is true to me and he is ambitious without my aid as the queen of he cannot obtain his ambition therefore he is bound to me by personal interests as well as political you have i see every confidence in him said after a pause every confidence answered with emphasis still i am on my guard against all men circumstances may turn the friend into the bitterest enemy the cardinal has all to by my restoration yet â who knows then you have not any confidence in him observed i have so far as i can judge replied the princess impatiently her former statements to all appearances he is thoroughly and if i know anything o the man he is so assuredly of one thing i am certain that whatever may he his views he will not betray me you instructed to tell him you are here in london no not until i see his attitude towards me but i have left much to the discretion of the in him i have great confidence here is the said suddenly looking up and my husband with him de turned pale as she saw the two men coming towards her much as she professed to trust in the cardinal yet she was of too a nature to believe wholly in his sincerity and dreaded lest should have failed in his mission she was reassured however by the face of the which expressed nothing but hope and contentment your majesty he said coming towards his mistress i have to announce to you that cardinal is devoted to your interests ah cried the princess with a flush of joy her face i knew i was not mistaken tell me what he said can we speak here said glancing around assuredly interposed promptly you may be certain that there is no traitor within these walls is utterly devoted to my interests and all those whom he has selected are as secret as the grave still there may be some one from without said impossible see we are in the terrace far removed from any trees which may afford a for a spy there are no boats on the water if we talk in a low tone we are safe villa come tell me all said impatiently taking no notice of this discussion you saw the cardinal yes madame on the application of we were admitted at once paid his respects to the cardinal as a englishman and his eminence had no suspicion as to the political nature of our errand he did not recognize you then no i was too well disguised for that and moreover kept in the background while talked to the cardinal about the

fall heavily upon the head of the s position was a very strange one there was so much that he wanted to do and so little that he could accomplish he had come there at first from motives of mere curiosity and the course that he afterwards adopted grew upon him unawares the change in all the habits of a lifetime astonished but did not dismay him he believed in the first place that was not he believed all that had told him of the purity of their relations and he felt that there was no such chasm to bridge as if the opposite had been true if he could show the full value of the treasure he had neglected there was great reason to hope that he would assume the right position at last g he used to picture to himself the united family the happy wife the fond husband and father and at such times he used to wonder why his own heart grew sick within him and why he felt like from the place where all this good result had grown from his unselfish efforts wrote to quite a month at least certainly much oftener than he did to his wife s answers were all from new york where he sent them to his and dealt solely with the ordinary affairs of the day when a letter came to him dated at boston and stating that had already arrived in america he was somewhat surprised as he had not expected him quite so soon it made him a little nervous too as he reflected that the must now be very near he was glad was in the country of course he was for had he not been hoping all the summer for his speedy return the sooner he reached the sooner the work of reconciliation could be begun but something was the matter with the he grew paler and neglected his meals and he began to haunt the neighborhood of the railroad station there was one train from the east that stopped at at about ten o clock in the morning and another at about eight at night all the other trains from that direction dashed contemptuously by the little village as if they had something of more importance to attend to than its insignificant interests went regularly to each of these trains thinking it best to welcome his friend at the threshold of the town he paced the platform sometimes half w hour before the train was due according t ov the printed posted on the walls of the wait ing room ho heard the of the carriages in the distance the shrill scream of the a mile away the roar of the approaching mass the hissing of the steam at night he saw the huge light come bearing down upon him like an demon there was nearly always somebody who alighted the mail bag was thrown off a trunk or two and a few express the conductor cried all aboard the wheels again and the long serpent vanished around the bend he went to the station for days and days and saw this repeated like a dream that comes and goes and never changes he saw this always but there was never any as the long time went by he grew bitter again was at boston five hours or so away from his wife after months of absence and did not think it worth his while to pay her even a brief visit it was even worse than this for showed in response to his hints that she believed her husband still in europe and had no intimation of the date when he might be

reader to itself but in all the plays of shakespeare and in the fiction of moat of the masters the opportunities are ample the supreme test of any subject which is to be given to students in their written work is whether it is one upon which it is reasonable to suppose they can and will have thought which is individual and therefore original if it were necessary to make nice distinctions between that which is and that which is not part of the study of literature as an art one must go much further than this the writing of however is part of the side of the work the main thing is talks on teaching literature to be sure that it is not dwelt upon more than is necessary and that it is within the range of the personal experience oi the student if teachers feel compelled to set their classes to write formal and lifeless on topics such as too often appear in examination papers they will do well to keep io mind that this is not the study of literature but a process which the power of appreciation and intelligent comprehension by mechanical imitation x in connection with the subject of this chapter i may mention a device which may not be without practical value in secondary school it a means of discovering how well the is succeeding in grasping general principles and in making actual application of them while at the same time it should impress upon him the y v fact that he is not studying merely a series of but the nature and qualities of literature on an examination paper in year english at the of was put this test it is assumed that the student never read tlie following extract state w hat seem its excellent points a of li of c ot to this was added a brief extract from some standard author the opening statement was made in order that the class should understand the to he not from any required reading but from some work entirely the points of excellence only were asked for order to fix attention on merits and indirectly to strengthen so far as might be the perception of the importance of looking in literature for merits rather than for defects it is undoubtedly proper that scholars should be able to perceive defects but this power is beat trained by them to be sensitive and to the necessities of time made it impossible to put upon the papers of which i am speaking of much length and the class were told that not was expected in comment upon the thought expressed the of tlie question that of seeing how the y were able to apply such principles as they had learned was also frankly put they were warned against and statements then they were left to their own devices the results were all suggestive and of course were of widely varying degrees of merit a few may be given chosen i confess from those more interesting on one paper were the opening lines of the second book of â paradise lost high oil a throne of state which tar tha of and of ind or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showers on her kings and gold exalted sat see page talks on literature among the were these of tbe of this selection we may say that it is good the selection of words ia especially forcible gorgeous east and richest hand are extremely so but what i consider a fine use of a word is the word here we can see the early inhabitants of the rich of the east the inhabitants ignorant of the value of their wealth throwing it around as we would the pebbles on a beach the thought and the imagination are good we can see before us the vividly picture there sits satan high above his surrounding in such rich and dazzling magnificence that it even the richest kings of the richest part of the world the best point of the consists iu placing the description first and not tbe thought until the last hue thus keeping the reader in suspense and causing careful attention to be put on all the sentence the words high throne royal and exalted combine to bring out the thought of satan a majesty the thought of unbounded wealth ia brought out by tbe use of the word showers in tbe third line the author is able to give a much more vivid idea oâ the magnificence of the throne by letting us the throne to suit ourselves than by giving a detailed description and leaving nothing to the imagination even the materials are only the whole idea being one of wealth and splendor the choice of words is one of the best points in the of the quotation the arrangement also adds emphasis all the descriptions of the throne are so vivid that the mind is deeply impressed by the splendor and richness of the throne the gorgeous east ia expressive of wealth and beauty with this ai of words the piece becomes veiy striking and the choice of the strongest is shown too in with the whole sentence whereas on the other hand if any other arrangement been much of the force of these words would have been lost the of the extract is to describe the great wealth and beauty with which satan is surrounded the writer must lave a very vivid imagination to describe such a scene of wealth and beauty the first word high appeals directly to the imagination and immediately gives the impression of power these answers were written by boys had not been called upon to do anything of the sort before and while their is evident enough they are genuine and are sound as far as they go of com se after such a test the first business of the teacher is to go over the selection ,3,Charles

went to bed he asked with a laugh in his voice i never raised a baby i ve come to talk about it though look here daniel i cried out with affected indignation i will not have my baby called it as if she were a stick or a stock he laughed outright at this then at my invitation sat down beside me we were silent for a time looking at the fading in the west and the single star swimming out of the purple as the sky changed into gray the were working at their music with all the of a child five finger exercises but their noise only made the evening more peaceful how it is i said to at last it almost makes one feel there can never be any again about anything daniel did not answer for a moment then he said with the solemnity of one who seldom puts sentiment into words â it is like the twenty third i simply assented and then we were silent again until at last he moved as if he were waking himself and sighed i always wonder whether somewhere in the past has had his romance and if so what it may have been if he has a night like this might well bring it up to his memory i am glad if it comes to him with the peace of a have you thought miss the asked the of a saint at length in the growing dark what a responsibility you are taking upon yourself in having that baby it was like the dear old man to have considered me and to look at the moral side of the question he wanted to help me i could see and of course he cannot understand how entirely religious one may be without i told him i had thought of it very seriously and it seemed to me sometimes that it was more than i was equal to but i added that i could not help thinking i could do better by baby than mrs mrs is no sort of a woman to bring up a child he agreed then he added with a that surprised me a little babies have got to be given baby treatment as well as baby food of course they have was my reply babies have a right to love as well as to milk and poor little would get very little from her grandmother daniel gave a contemptuous that woman couldn t really love anything he declared or if she did she d show it by being hateful i said she certainly loved tom yes he retorted and she s him to death for my part i can t more than half blame tom as i ought to when i think of his having had his mother to thorn him then you do think it s better for baby to be with me than with her grandmother i asked him it s a hundred times better of course but i wondered if you d thought of the responsibility of its â of her religious instruction we had come to the true of the s june errand i really believe that in his mind was more concern for me than for baby he is always unhappy that i am not in the fold of the church and i fancy that more or less he was making of an excuse for an attempt to reach me it is not difficult to understand his feeling mother used to affirm that are anxious to because they cannot bear to have anybody refuse to acknowledge that they are right this is not i am sure the whole of it of course no human being likes to be thought wrong especially on a thing which like religion cannot be proved but there is a good deal of genuine love in the attempt of a man like daniel to convert an he is really grieved for me and i would do anything short of actual to make him suppose that i believed as he would have me i should so like him to be happy about my eternal welfare when the future does not in the least trouble me it seems such a pity that he should be disturbed i told him to night i should not give baby what he would call religious instruction but i should never interfere if others should teach her if they made what is good attractive but you would tell her that religion is n t true he objected oh no i answered i should have to be honest and tell her if she asked that i don t believe we know anything about another life but of course as far as living in this one goes i should n t with religion he tried to argue with me but i entirely refused to be led on daniel i told him i know it is all the of a saint in your kindness for me that you would talk but i refuse to have this beautiful summer evening wasted on you could n t convince me and i don t in the least care about convincing you i am entirely content that you should believe your way and i am entirely satisfied with mine now i want to talk with you about our having a reading room next winter so i got him to another subject and what is better i think i really interested him in my scheme of opening a free library if we can once get that to working it will be a great help to the young men and boys the time seems to have come in human development i remember father s saying not long before he died when men must be controlled by the instead of by the of their minds june i have been considering why it is that i have had so much said to me ,3,Charles Dickens

but having made one mistake â as he plainly saw mrs s attitude â he did not wish to make another you will keep your promise of silence he urged earnestly yes on condition that you make no attempt to run away with the girl from that i speak in your own interest you will get into trouble if you take an insane woman from her lawful guardian you seem to be quite certain that is mad said bitterly however as you know my secret and i am at your mercy i promise i think that you are very ungrateful cried mrs many another woman would have declined to keep what you call the secret at all i have made a mistake confessed and he could have kicked himself that he a man of the world should be such a fool well said mrs as the door opened to admit the servant with afternoon tea let us say no more about it i promise to hold my tongue for a month and you promise to leave the girl alone meanwhile waited until the tea tray was arranged and the girl had departed no he said i have been wrong and you have shown me my duty i shall call on major to morrow and explain the sealed message you cannot replied mrs the major is in this announcement complicated matters then i follow to said my mistake must be put right chapter x the it is admitted that man as a whole is not hut each individual man has a secret belief that he is was no more complacent than other mortals â in fact less yet he had an idea that his caution and common sense invariably prevented his making mistakes assuredly as a rule he was rarely in error but to every rule there is an exception and ill judged frankness to mrs was the exception in this case it said much for s sane view of life that he recognized his mistake at once and at the cost of some hastened to correct it this an interview with major which was likely to be a stormy one at the outset believed that he had read mrs s character all wrong and that even after years of close companionship â since she had been so intimate with his mother â he knew very little about her had she really been that which he believed her to be she would â he thought immediately on leaving court â have readily helped him in his somewhat eccentric but on calmer reflection he arrived at the conclusion that he himself was in error his first mistake lay in overlooking the relationship existing between and the widow being e loo the sealed message to him â as she had admitted â she certainly could not be expected to act against what she believed to be his interests and his second mistake consisted in hoping that mr â who in many ways was particularly conventional â would take charge of a girl believed to be insane it was only natural that mrs should believe to be mad as being willing to accept the major as her second husband she could scarcely credit him with conspiracy and if was not insane her in the s house was certainly a conspiracy against her rights as a human being took this view from personal observation and because he but mrs as engaged to marry the major could not be expected to a theory which would render unworthy of her hand or indeed of her acquaintance it may be here mentioned that had not mentioned the wonderful likeness which existed between charity and since the thought had flashed across him while speaking that such a statement might in the mysterious business which was not to be thought of all mrs practically knew was that loved a insane ward of her promised husband and desired her to side against that promised husband so that he might marry the girl it was impossible to expect that any woman would act in this way and acknowledged to himself that mrs had behaved in a perfectly reasonable manner in refusing to help him in fact she had behaved extremely well in holding to her promise of one month s secrecy for many a woman would have told there and then what had been said about him therefore mrs was not only right but felt that he was entirely in the the sealed message loi wrong felt indeed that he had acted somewhat the sole way in which he could right matters and recover his self respect was to see as soon as possible and explain himself then as man to man they could the matter out with this idea drove back to his rooms in street intending to change and pack and catch the midnight train from to but while dressing he reflected that it would be better to first assure himself that mrs was correct in stating the major s whereabouts s rooms were also in street and only a few doors away so it would be just as well to run in and to make inquiries might return on the morrow in which case it would hardly be worth while to journey to so hurriedly also mrs having promised to hold her tongue for one month there was no necessity to act at once since two or three or even more days would make very little difference finally was unwilling to return to the s house and to until he knew if his theory regarding a possible will was correct otherwise he would have nothing to tell her while meditating on the of calling at s rooms desired to smoke to aid his thoughts after the manner of men he mechanically took his but found some difficulty in opening it as his case was usually easy to open he

being among the ai which are supposed to enter into the calculations of every young woman the idea of taking a name which was not her husband s was another thing and too ridiculous she said it suggested the weak minded of strong minded women far more closely than was at all pleasant but as for having aunt s money go to those disagreeable girls declared she would sooner take forty names or have no the man committed i name at all and so it ended in the of powers on behalf of mrs as well as of her husband with the ultimate result that the young couple became known as mr and mrs a of which put them in very serious doubts as to who they might really be it chanced that about the time matters were settled the date arrived when the pair had planned to visit to avoid the of the boston spring but what are we to call ourselves demanded as they were discussing details you say you cannot reach until a week after i do and it will certainly look peculiar enough for mrs to announce that she is expecting her husband mr in a few days i simply shall refuse to recognize you when you get there it is too utterly ridiculous for our names to be different nonsense replied you could n t help rushing to meet me if you were called van and i peter you me too much to resist me especially after a week s separation you you horribly conceited wretch cried his wife i never speak in the bundle of time one

stepped upon the hotel at but a single glance at the self possessed little woman who sat with an elderly lady in frosty curls showed him what was before him the faintest flush swept over mrs s smooth cheek as mr in passing the ladies lifted his hat but no other sign would have indicated to the most acute observer the fact that she had any previous acquaintance with that gentleman she went serenely on with her apparently as intent upon its conventional beauties and as deeply interested in miss s gossip as before she had been prepared for this encounter she had known to a minute the probable time of her husband s arrival and had taken her place here for the especial purpose of him she soon the man committed excused herself and went to her room where she executed a series of girlish of wild glee but hardly with the highest of dignity then she made the most of and went down to dinner fate or so contrived as to fix that gentleman s place opposite his wife s at table mrs s first feeling at this arrangement was one of pleased amusement yet she felt it to be in a manner a challenge her love of mischief asserted itself and throughout the meal although she was unusually she totally ignored mr he made some advances in the good graces of miss whose seat was next his own discovering that they had common acquaintances in the north and by the time dinner was ended patience not being the strongest trait of his character he thought himself in a position to make use of that elderly maiden s good offices may i ask the name of the lady opposite he questioned as they left the table she was sitting with you on the when i came her face seems familiar that is mrs answered miss delighted to be able to give information she is from boston have n t the bundle of time you ever met her she is very intimate with the of whom we were speaking oh that is why her face seems so familiar was reply shall i be too much upon your kindness if i ask for an introduction i shall be pleased to present

and the flowers blow i drift through the year with summer and with with the changing months i keep high in all the i sit at home and walk with and if the sun that the sap also the wish to wander i remember my fellow on bv i and i that romantic craft and looking round upon my peaceful room and pressing more closely the arm of i feel that i have reached the port for which they hopelessly sailed and when winds blow fiercely and the night storm and the thought of lost and of perilous voyages touches the soft heart of i hear a voice sweeter to my ear than that of the to the tempest sailor thank god your only is in the flying bv look here upon this and on thia bv family look here upon this and on this hamlet we have no family pictures and i only a portrait of my grandmother hangs upon our parlor wall it was taken at least a century ago and represents the venerable lady whom i remember in my childhood in spectacles and comely cap as a young and blooming girl she is sitting upon an old fashioned sofa by the of a aunt of hers and with her back to the open window her costume is but handsome it consists of a cream colored dress made high in the throat ruffled around the neck and over the bosom and the shoulders the waist is just under her shoulders and the sleeves are tight than any of our coat sleeves and also at the wrist around the plump and rosy neck which i remember as and sallow and hidden under a decent lace handkerchief hangs in the picture bv and i a of large beads there are two curls upon the forehead and the rest of the hair flows away in down the neck the hold an open book the eyes look up from it with tranquil sweetness and through the open window behind you see a quiet landscape â a hill a tree the glimpse of a river and a few peaceful summer clouds often in my younger days when my grandmother sat by the fire after dinner lost in thought â perhaps remembering the time when the picture was really a portrait â i have curiously compared her wasted face with the blooming beauty of the girl and tried to detect the likeness it was strange how the resemblance would sometimes start out how as i gazed and gazed upon her old face age disappeared before my eager glance as snow in the sunshine revealing the flowers of a forgotten spring it was touching to see my grandmother steal quietly up to her portrait on still summer mornings when every one had left the house â and i the only child played disregarded â and look at it wistfully and long she held her hand over her eyes to shade them from the light that streamed in at the window and i have seen her stand at least a quarter of an hour gazing at the picture she said nothing bv family made no motion she shed no tear but when she turned away there was always a pensive sweetness ill lier face that made it not less lovely than the face of her youth i have learned since what her thoughts must have been â how that long wistful glance time and space how forms and faces to any other rose in sudden around her â how she loved suffered struggled and conquered again how many a jest that i shall never hear how many a game that i shall never play how many a song that i shall never sing were all renewed and remembered as my grandmother contemplated her picture i stand as she stood gazing earnestly at the picture so long and so silently that looks up from her work and says she shall be jealous of that beautiful my grandmother who yet makes her think more kindly of those remote old times yes and that is the a family portrait yes again but says when he hears the remark how if one s grandmother were a a a ah in that case â i am compelled to say while looks up again half and i add j â â you for instance bv and i then smiles one of his sad smiles and we change the subject yet i am always glad when our who knows that my opportunities are few comes to ask me to step round and see the family portraits the i think are a very old family says they date from the but i thought people of english descent preferred to stop with william the conqueror who came from france before going with i always myself with a glance at the great family bible in which adam eve and the are indifferently well represented those are the ancestors of the the and the says surprising me with her have you any mr she who only smiles upon the dear woman while i am my coat then we step along the street and i am conscious of trembling a little for i feel as if i were going to court suddenly we are standing before the range of portraits this says with is sir solomon the founder of the family famous for what i ask respectfully bv family portraits s for the family replies gravely and i have sometimes thought a little severely this he says pointing to a dame in and diamond this is lady ah yes famous for what i inquire for being of sir solomon then in order comes a gentleman in a huge curling wig looking indifferently like james the second or louis the and holding a in his hand the right honorable lord seal etc etc a delicate beauty between a face fair and loved and lost centuries ago â a song ,16,Rudyard Kipling

i beg your pardon i said but i am going to take the same trip to morrow and i shall be more than pleased if you will honor me with your company the frenchman hesitated me with some surprise you are extremely kind he replied as i was saying i dislike these lonely journeys are you is there anyone else to go with you no i said unless you accept i shall be entirely alone then he answered as if relieved i shall do so with great pleasure remarking to the agent that he would not need a carriage of his own now the gentleman walked out of the office with me our conversation begun so abruptly continued as we strolled together along the line of the sea coast in an opposite direction from my hotel when i him my card he searched in his pocket for his own card case and then finding that he had left it in his room informed out op me that his name was and that he was the country for pleasure like myself i learned in the course of the next hour that this was his second visit to africa and that he had also the on a previous occasion it is worth seeing a second time he remarked earnestly i think it one of the most entertaining places i ever saw the last time i was there an event occurred that i shall not soon forget i looked the inquiry i did not need to put into words it was a strange affair continued m i was with a party of sight among whom was a very young lady of your perhaps i should bore you with ihe history i had caught so eagerly at the few words already uttered that i had difficulty in my if ty to hear the rest lest i should excite his suspicions i replied as calmly as possible that i should like very much to hear of ihe as of the common possessed a peculiar charm for me well said m a moment s pause it was this way there was in the party a gentleman who had it seemed conceived a violent passion for the young lady which she did not wholly return he had formed the very unique plan of one of the lo marry them without her knowledge i uttered an exclamation of surprise her knowledge i yes it was this way m had like many men a warm lo a phrase the young lady understood very hide if meeting ny french which was the native tongue of her he believed in his and you know there is nothing so blind as a lover that if he could get a ceremony performed he could persuade her to abide by it and become his wife in reality i interrupted to ask what had taken place up to that time whether the gentleman had told the lady of his love and been rejected or whether he had held his secret locked in his own bosom it was this way replied m the gentleman had been presented to the lady and had made known his passion she had answered by the very strange statement that she was wholly averse to marriage and would not listen to a proposal of that kind from anyone at first he thought this a mere pretext a more courteous way of saying farewell than by a direct being in love to an extreme degree he was not willing to surrender his hopes without doing his utmost to bring them to full he therefore as is customary in such cases made liberal presents to the lady s maid and seeking to learn through them the real condition of her mind in spite of his generosity both of them persisted that had told him the truth they said she was one of those women who have a positive aversion for matrimony and being possessed of an ample fortune had determined to enjoy it alone by the of the wedded state do what he could they stuck to one story the same in effect that the lady had given him then it was that he resolved to try the plan i have mentioned believing she might when he had a document in his hand that she was already his wife out or it was an odd history truly and i showed the interest i felt so strongly that my companion looked gratified one of the things about any recital is to secure a thoroughly attentive listener and did the scheme succeed i asked though feeling certain that miss was the lady i need not say the question was superfluous no said m and i thought he spoke it was this way the idea was to arrange the matter with one of the oldest the lady was told that she would see an of the work of the order the way was led into the chapel and the services proceeded to the evident entertainment of all was apparently going well there were no persons present except the three i have mentioned the lady s maid and myself i interrupted to remark that my had evidently been let into the secret of his friend s purpose yes he said it was this way i fully with his ardent desire to possess that beautiful creature his intentions were in the highest degree honorable though his method of the desired result could only be justified by the proverb all s fair in love and war my friend be it understood belonged to both those branches holding a commission in the service of the republic and being at the time near here with his regiment i reasoned that there would be no harm in the affair for even if the performed a religious ceremony which the lady accepted it would according to french law require still another ceremony a civil meeting one to make it binding it was merely ,1,Arthur Conan Doyle

sold do not let your mind live in an island if your body does was a favorite saying of william hope and we recommend it to and on one of hope s visits complained he had nothing to do i can sit here

don t pay and don t pay but brains and money pay wherever found together â what on a farm why not sir you have only to go with the times observe the condition of produce grain too cheap for a farmer because can grain with little loss fruit dear meat dear because cattle can not be driven and sailed without risk of life and loss of weight agricultural labor rising and in winter because to farm means to plough and sow and reap and and lose m but meet those conditions breed cattle sheep and horses and make the farm their feeding ground give fifty acres to fruit have a little factory on the land for winter use and so all your farm hands and the village women who are cheaper than town and i think you will make a little money in the form of money besides what you make in eggs poultry fruit

friend was when he took up a vein like this neither could he imagine little in the of an for such a very wise man as not only much her senior but a thousand times her superior in knowledge and acquaintance with things that people talk about keep your eye on her she will be worth watching said with one of his laughs at the sober face before him she is worth almost as much to a rising author as the negro not quite but nearly then there is the is there anything in him no he will be of no service to you and that brings us back to our superb with whom you must now be wildly shook his head again no not yet he said but what do you do all the time how can you f a black sit by the side of a pretty girl and kiss her cheeks and put your arm around her and yet keep from falling in love the younger man gasped at each of these suggestions like one who has stepped into icy water and feels it gradually creeping upward i have done none of those things he faltered none of them then i shall not let you stay here cried what does the girl expect that we are going to make her reputation in the literary world and get nothing for ourselves i never heard such she refuses to give you the least opportunity does she the more and more confused grew the other at these expressions you don t understand you are quite in error he she she has refused me nothing because because i have asked nothing mr uttered a groan but this will not do my dear fellow he said how can you accomplish anything unless you make a beginning the story that she has written will not advance you one step on the path you profess such anxiety to tread that is only an excuse a make believe a pretence under which you have been given quarters in this house and allowed every chance in creation to learn your lesson are you afraid of her or what is the matter does she you with her beauty tell me where your difficulty lies but could hardly answer these apparently simple questions he said he feared the trouble holding her hand might be in the formality of the situation how could mr expect he asked that a spontaneous case of love making would develop from such a condition of things stuff cried with a if you and she were members of a theatrical company and were cast as a pair of lovers you wouldn t find so many you would go ahead and repeat the lines of your part wouldn t you all you want is to do the same now but what are the lines of my part inquired the other take her hand once in yours and they will come to you retorted so much that regretted the severity of his tone and hastened to turn the conversation to something more agreeable he made up his mind however to have a talk with miss and at the first opportunity he did so it was on an afternoon when he knew was in the city and he came to the point at once after his own fashion how are you and my young friend getting along he asked her oh as well as possible she responded i am learning to like him more and more i really shall be sorry when his task is done mr shrugged his shoulders there s a bit of selfishness in your words miss he said have you forgotten that he is not here to be useful to you alone that you agreed to do what you could for him t as well i black the girl cast down her pretty eyes in confusion i am sure i have tried to be agreeable she replied gently that is not enough replied gravely what he needs is something some one to stir his blood to awaken his fancy i told you in the first place that you ought to make him fall in love with you for literary reasons he must feel a sensation stronger than mere friendship for a woman before he can write such a story as will bring him fame miss did not grow more comfortable under this suggestion she remarked after a long wait that she did not see how the end sought was to be accomplished love she said was not a mere expression it was a deep actual two people playing at love with each other might afterwards find that that they were with fire i have heard she continued her fair cheeks growing crimson that there are women then she paused and could go no further but he understood there are women thousands of them he admitted who would willingly do what i ask if it is necessary he must go to them she wanted to say that she hoped it would not come to that she wanted to convey to her companion the horror she felt for what she supposed his words implied but she could

felt somehow i believe the breaking of my engagement has made me seem older to them perhaps it is my foolish fancy but i seem to see that while i was engaged i had still for them a hold on youth which i have now lost i suppose they never thought it out but i know they feel now that i am very much their senior at a time like this too i realize how true it is that the of a saint i am somehow a little outside of the life of the village i have lived here almost all my life except for the years i was at school and a winter or two in boston or abroad i have been generally at home i know almost everybody in town by sight at least yet i always find when i am among people in this way that i am looking at them as if i were a spectator i wonder if this means that i am or queer or only that my life has been so much more among books and intellectual things than the life of most of them i am sure i love the town and my neighbors the thing i wish to put down however has nothing to do with my feelings toward the town it is that i am ashamed of the way i wrote the other day about mr he entered the hall this after noon just as old mrs came in to see the and the lovely way in which he helped the poor old lame creature made me blush for myself i almost wanted to go to him and then and there it would have been awkward however first to explain that i had made fun of him in my and then but he is a good soul even if he did think i was a sort of nineteenth century to give up for the sake of wedding a christian chief â and here i go again i august i have been reading to night a book about the east and it has stirred me a good deal the speculations of strange on the great mystery of life and death bring them so close to us they show how alike all mankind is and how we all about after some clue to existence on the whole it is better i think not to give much thought to what may august come after death â no more thought that is than we cannot help we can never know and we must either raise vague hopes to make us less alive to the importance of life the reality of life â i do not know how to say it of course all religion on the importance of life hut rather as a preparation for another existence i think we need to have it always before us that what is important is not what will happen after we are dead and but what is a win â i see this is not very clear but i am sure the great thing is to live as if life were of value in itself to live rightly to make the most out of the life we can see and feel is all that humanity is equal to and it is certainly worth doing for its own sake the idea which has struck me most in what i have been reading to night is the theory that each individual is made up of the fragments of other lives that just as the body is composed of material once part of other bodies so is the spirit built up of feelings and passions and tendencies and traits of temperament formerly in other individuals dead and gone at first thought it does not seem to me a comfortable theory i should not seem to belong to myself any more if i believed it to have the temper of some woman and the affections of another and the tastes of a third â it is too much like wearing false hair it does not seem to me possible but it may be true at least it is a theory which may easily be made to seem plausible by the use of facts we all know if it is the true solution of our characters here it is pleasant to think that perhaps we may what for the present is our very own self so it shall be better stuff for the of another generation i should the of a saint like to feel that when this bunch of ideas and emotions goes to pieces the bits would make sweet spots in the individuals they go to make part of i suppose this is what george meant in the choir invisible or something like this as one thinks of the doctrine it is hot so cold and as it struck me in the reading one could bear to lose a conscious future if the alternative was happiness to lives not yet in being i should like though to know it but if there were n t any me to know i should not be troubled as the old philosophers were fond of saying and the important thing would be not for me to know but for the world to be better i begin to see how the doctrine might be a fine to do the best with life that is in any way possible and what more could be asked of any doctrine august baby was ill night before last and we three women were smitten to the heart went for dr and when he came he laughed at our panic and assured me nothing serious was the matter it was only a little caused by the excessive heat i do not know how i should have behaved if it had not been that was in such a panic i had to give all my spare attention to keeping her in ,3,Charles Dickens

all that money can buy second those who belong to what are called the good old families because some was a man of mark in the state or country or was very rich and has kept the fortune in the family

has no more shyness than a brass monkey that s vulgar of course i meant it to be to match the subject i put in a weak of mrs although i honestly do find her a most unsatisfactory person she is self conscious and somehow she does not seem to me to be very frank very likely moreover she july had been disconcerted by the too evident of my cousin if i her was the with which a suggestion of this sort was met i m sure i am not ashamed of it to think of her saying that you evidently wanted to show how to do things in style does she think any person with style would let her into the house i thanked her for the compliment to me oh bother i she retorted you are only a goose with no sense at all to think you once thought of marrying that country yourself i was too much hurt to reply and probably my face showed my feeling for cousin burst into a laugh you need n t look so about it she cried all s well that ends well you re safely out of that thank heaven i felt that loyalty to george required that i should protest but she interrupted me don t be a she said and for pity s sake don t be such a fool as to try to yourself you re not a sentimental to moon after a man especially when he s shown what his taste is by taking up with such a horror as mrs i am fond of him i asserted enough she seized me by the shoulders and looked with her quick black eyes into mine so that i felt as if she could see down to my very toes can you look me in the face and tell me you really care for a man who could marry that ignorant vulgar woman just for her pretty face can you fool into thinking that you have n t the of a saint had a lucky escape from a man that s in every way your inferior you know you have why can you honestly think now for a moment of marrying him without feeling your all fortunately she did not insist upon my answering her but shook me and let me go i doubt if i could have borne to have her press her questions i was suddenly conscious that george has changed or that my idea of him has altered and that if he were still single i could not marry him under any circumstances cousin went home this morning but her talk has been in my mind all day it comes over me that i have lost more than george his loving another did not deprive me of the power or the right to love him and his marriage simply set him away from my life in some other life if there be one i might have always been sure he would come back to me i cannot help knowing i fed his higher nature and i helped him to grow while his wife appeals to something lower even if it is more natural and human i felt that in some other possible existence he would see more clearly and she would no longer satisfy him now i begin to feel that i have lost more than i knew i have lost not only him but i have lost â no i cannot have lost my love for him it is only that to night i am foolish it is rainy dreary hopeless and seeing mrs through cousin s eyes has put things all yet why not put it down since i have begun if i am to write at all it should be the truth i am beginning to see that the man i loved was not george so much as a creature i up in his image i see him now in a colder july a more sane light and i find that i am not looking at the man who filled my heart and thought he has somehow changed this would be a comfort to some i suppose i see now how mother felt about him she never thought him what he seemed to me and she always believed that sooner or later i should be disappointed in him i should not have been disappointed if i had married him â i think yet now i see how he is under the influence of his wife â but no it is not her influence only i see him now i fear as he is when he is free to act his true self unmoved by the desire to be what i would have had him he was influenced by me i knew it from the very first and i see with shame how proud of it i was yet it gave me a chance to help him to grow with him to feel that we were together developing and advancing oh dear how cold and superior and conceited it so now it is on paper i it truly was not that i thought i was above him but it is surely the part of a woman to inspire her lover and to grow into something better with him now it seems as if whatever george did he did for me and not because of any inner love for growth he appears now less worthy by just so much as what he was seems to me higher than what he is i have lost what he was it is cruel that i cannot find the george i cared for it is hard to believe he existed only in my mind july i have been reading over what i wrote last night it troubles me and it has a most self righteous flavor but i cannot see that it is not true it troubles me ,3,Charles Dickens

our vast superiority the squeezed and other tokens of the kind show that our civilization has not yet the conception of the most that woman exists for the delight of man and is meant to be a kind of decorated of his life while the men attendants and men nurses of women prisoners and show a most disregard of the just instincts of sex we are far from asserting that therefore the position of women in this country is to be to their position in china where the contempt of men denied them souls or to that among woman s dress savage tribes where they are treated as beasts of burden but because we are not in the of it does not follow that we are sitting in the house beautiful the traveller who has climbed to the de at and sees the valley wide outstretched far below him sees also far above him the awful dome of whatever point we may have reached there is still a higher point to gain nowhere in the world are women so truly respected as here nowhere ought they to be more happy than in this country but that is no reason that the new outrage should be possible while the same good sense and love of justice which have removed so many to fair play for women should press on more cheerfully than ever to remove those that remain december secret societies the melancholy death of young mr a student at the university has undoubtedly occasioned a great deal of thought in every college in the country upon secret societies professor of has written a very careful and serious letter in which he strongly them plainly stating their great and the order of as the most powerful and thoroughly organized of all secret associations therefore the one in which their character and tendency may best be observed the debate the history of the excitement in this country which is how secret societies ever seldom mentioned in recent years so that the facts may not be familiar to the reader in the year william living in in the western part of new york near was supposed to intend the publication of a book which would reveal the secrets of the in the vicinity were angry and resolved to prevent the publication and made several forcible but attempts for that purpose on the of september a party of persons from came to and procured the arrest of upon a criminal charge and he was carried to for examination he was but was immediately arrested upon a civil process upon which an execution was issued and he was imprisoned in the jail at the next evening he was dis charged at the instance of those who had caused his arrest and was taken from the jail after nine o clock in the evening those who had obtained the discharge instantly seized him and bound him and throwing him into a carriage hurried off to by of horses and by different hands he was borne along until he was lodged in the magazine of fort at the mouth of the river the circumstances of his arrest and those that had preceded it had aroused and the minds of the people in and the neighborhood a committee was appointed at a public meeting to ascertain all the facts and to bring to justice any that might be found they could discover only that had been seized upon his discharge in and hurried off towards but beyond that secret societies nothing the excitement deepened and spread a great crime had apparently been committed and it was hidden in absolute secrecy other meetings were held in other towns and other were appointed and both meetings and were composed of men of both political parties investigation showed that only were in the crime and that scarcely a aided the inquiry that many and even justified the offence that the were with their inability to procure the punishment of the in courts where judges and witnesses were that witnesses disappeared that the were and gradually itself was held responsible for the mysterious doom of the excitement became a frenzy the were hated and as the irish were in london after the irish night or the roman during the fury in january some of those who had been arrested were tried and it was hoped that the evidence at their trials would clear the mystery but they pleaded guilty and this hope was baffled meanwhile a body of from the various met at to ascertain the fate of and they discovered that in or near the magazine in which he had been confined he had been put to death his book with its revelations had been published and what was not told was of course declared to be infinitely worse than the actual the excitement now became political it was alleged that held itself superior to the laws and that were more loyal to their secret societies ic oaths than to their

as the paper wishes it to be this is more than an affair of the private wishes or of the paper to cook the news is a public wrong and a of the moral contract which the newspaper makes with the public to supply the news and to use every reasonable effort to obtain it not to manufacture it either in the office or by correspondence july if as a new york paper recently said the is the orator it is full time for the work upon journals and which has loo been lately issued in london the new york writer holds that in our political the campaign speech is not intended or adapted to persuade or convert but merely to and encourage friends the party meetings on each side he thinks are composed of and the more extravagant the assertion and the more the of the enemy the more the enthusiasm of the audience in fact his theory of campaign speeches is that they are merely the addresses of to their armies on the eve of battle which are not arguments since argument is not needed but mere urgent appeals to party feeling thirty centuries look down from yonder is the tone of the campaign speech as an election is an appeal to the final of the popular judgment newspaper loi the apparent object of election is to affect the popular decision but this the is not done by the orator for the reason just stated but by the journal the newspaper addresses the not with periods and but with facts and figures and arguments which the can and at his leisure and not under the excitement or the of a spoken the newspaper also unless it be a mere party organ is candid to the other side and states the situation fairly moreover the of a daily issue and of great space to fill produce a fulness and variety of information and of argument which are really the source of most of the speeches so that the orator to his audience an imperfect abstract of a complete and ample plea and the orator it is asserted would often i serve his cause infinitely better by reading a carefully written article than by pouring out his loose and but the argument for the newspaper can be pushed still further since has become universal and the speaker is conscious that his very words will be spread the next morning before hundreds of thousands of readers it is of those readers and not of the thousand hearers before him of whom he thinks and for whom his address is really prepared formerly a single charge was all that was needed for the of a whole political campaign the speech that was originally carefully prepared was known practically only to the audience that heard it it grew better and brighter with the of repeated delivery and was fresh and new to every new newspaper audience but now when delivered to an audience it is spoken to the whole country it is often in type before it is uttered so that the orator is in fact repeating the article of to morrow morning the result is good so far as it him to precision of statement but it inevitably suggests the question whether the newspaper is not correct in its assertion that the great object of the is accomplished not by the orator but by the writer but this after all is like asking whether a copy of a great picture does not painting and prove it to be an or art is an art and its peculiar charm and power cannot be by any other art great are now prepared with care and may be printed word for word but the reading cannot produce the impression of the i hearing we can all read the words that spoke on hill at the laying of the corner stone of the monument fifty years after the battle but those who saw him standing there in his majestic prime and speaking to that vast throng heard and saw and felt something that we cannot know the ordinary stump speech which imperfectly echoes a leading article can well be spared but the speech of an orator still remains a work of art the words of which may be accurately while the spirit and glow and inspiration of utterance which made it a work of art cannot be the general statement of the critic however remains true and the effective work of a political campaign is certainly done by the newspaper the newspaper is of two kinds again â that which shows exclusively the virtue and newspaper of the party it and that which aims to be and impartial the tendency of the first kind is obvious enough but that of the last is not less positive if less obvious the tendency of the independent newspaper is to good natured indifference the very often and with which a side is prejudices such a paper against the cause itself because the hot orator that the success of the adversary would ruin the country the independent suggests that the country is not so easily ruined and that such an argument is a reason for against the orator the position that in a party contest it is six on one side and half a dozen on the other is too much akin to the doctrine that naught is everything and everything is naught to be very with men who are really in io earnest such a position in public affairs inevitably and often very to them produces an impression of want of hearty conviction which influence as effectually as the evident prejudice and partiality of the party advocate thorough independence

very ill yes was all he answered and tom i hurried on george won t her won t her he echoed the cur november he was here yesterday i went on desperately â and he said he is determined to marry me tom started forward with hot face and clenched fist the i i wish i d been here to kick him out of the house what did you say to him i told him he had insulted me and forbade him to come here again without mr to them i said then before tom s searching look i became so confused he could not help seeing there was more well he demanded he was although he was courteous men have such a way in a crisis of instinctively taking the lead that a woman to it almost of necessity tom i answered more and more confused i must tell you but i hope you understand i had a frightful time with him i was ashamed of him and ashamed of myself and very angry and when he said he d make me marry him sometime i told him â well demanded tom his voice much lower than before but even more compelling i told him said i the blood fairly throbbing in my cheeks that i should marry you you ve asked me you know he grew fairly white but for a moment he did not move his eyes had a look in them i had never seen and which made me tremble it seemed to me that he was fighting down what he wanted to say and to get control of himself he asked me at last with an odd in his voice do you want george to marry that woman the of a saint of course i do i cried so surprised and relieved that the question was not more personal the tears started to my eyes i want it more than anything else in the world again he was still for a moment his eyes looking into mine as if he meant to drag out my most secret thought these were too much for me to bear and i broke this one i asked him if he were vexed at what i had said to george and told him the words had seemed to say themselves without any will of mine i could only be sorry at anything you said he returned never vexed i only think it a pity for you to link your name with mine i tried to speak but he went on i ve loved you ever since i was old enough to love anything i ve told you that often enough and i don t think you doubt it i had you as my ambition all the time i was growing up i came home from college and you were engaged and all the good was taken out of life for me i ve never cared much since what happened but if i ve asked you to love me i never gave you the right to think i d be base enough to be willing you should marry me without loving me again i tried to speak though i cannot tell what i wished to say i only choked and could not get out a word don t talk about it i can t stand it he broke in his voice you need n t marry me to make george come up to the mark i ll take care of that i suppose i looked up with a dread of what might happen if he saw george and of course tom could november not understand that my concern was for him and not for george he smiled a bitter sort of smile you need n t be afraid he said i treat him tenderly for your sake i was too confused to speak and i could only sit there dazed and silent while he went away it was not what he was saying that filled me with a tumult till my thoughts seemed beating in my head like wild birds in a net suddenly while he was speaking while his dear honest eyes full of pain were looking into mine the still small voice had spoken and i knew that i cared for tom as he cared for me november i realize now that from the morning when tom and i first stood with baby in my arms between us i have felt differently toward him it was at the moment almost as if i were his wife and though i never owned it to myself even in my most secret thought i have somehow belonged to him ever since i see now that something very deep within has known and has from time to time tried to tell me but i put my hands to the ears of my mind miss used to try to teach us things at school about the difference between the consciousness and the will and other dark mysteries which to me were and are and always will be utterly incomprehensible and i suppose some kind of a consciousness knew what the will would n t recognize that sounds like nonsense now it is on paper but it seemed extremely wise when i began to write it no matter the facts i know well enough it is wonderful how a woman will hide a thing from herself a thing she knows really but keeps from being conscious she knows by refusing to let her thoughts put it into words the of a saint to myself i seem â and yet it seems also as if i had never changed at all but that it was always tom i have been fond of even when i fully believed it was george of course this is only a weak excuse but at least i have been fond of tom as a friend from my childhood he has always ,3,Charles Dickens
you said the negro in his pleasant and strong tones let me take your hat and stick now sir this way t miss came tn a few the parlor where was left and greeted him most cordially there is a sitting room on the next floor she said where we shall not be disturbed i have given orders to admit no one saying that we shall want the evening entirely to ourselves repeated the visitor is that the name of the remarkable individual who received me just now yes said miss rather coldly though i do not know why you call him remarkable he is so tall so grand so entirely overpowering explained mr one would think he might be the son of an african king i never saw a black man that gave me such an impression of force and power elevated her eyebrows a little as it annoyed at these expressions she answered still rigidly that she had noticed nothing unusual about kiss she did not believe she had looked closely enough at his face to be able to identify him in a court he would make a fine character for a novel said mr as they walked together up the broad staircase i could almost write one myself around such a personality the young lady looked disgusted a negro servant she exclaimed what kind of a novel could you write with such a central figure perhaps i should not put him in the centre laughed determined to win her good nature every story needs lights and shades you can t deny that he would cast a magnificent shadow the humor of this observation struck miss and she joined mildly in her companion s mirth then she remarked that the central figure of a novel the main in it to her mind should be a being who could be given the attributes of beauty and grace the minor characters were of less account and would come into existence almost of their own accord and now before we do anything more she said i want you to tell me about that excessively handsome young man that i saw with you yesterday in square was delighted at this introduction of his young friend he began a most flattering account of describing him as a genuine among men both in talent and goodness he drew heavily on his imagination as he proceeded a black j feeling that he was in for it and might as well do his best at once and he could see the cheek of the young listener taking on a new and more color as he went farther and farther into his sub if i have to my novel the one mr rejected i shall draw my hero after that model she cried when he paused for breath i never saw a man who came so near my ideal but you would have to alter your hero s character in that case he said i have read your and your description does not with my young friend at all miss you don t mean to claim do you she replied that physical beauty and moral goodness always go hand in hand they should he answered in a tone that was meant to be impressive ah that is another question do they that is all the needs to know did you ever read s there are the two sisters one as pure as can be the other quite the opposite and the beauty belongs to the one i know takes a different view in grey but he is wrong i am sure that the worst man or woman in the world reckoning by what are called the amiable vices might be the most lovely to look upon the most delightful to associate with eve found the serpent attractive remember where did she learn all these things looked studying miss at her with increasing astonishment amiable vices he liked the perhaps you are right he assented as if slowly convinced if you wish to be acquainted with mr i will bring him here with pleasure my only fear is that he will not interest you he seems almost too perfect for earth think of a young man who knows nothing of women who says he has no idea what it is to be in love who does not understand why the ladies who pass down fifth avenue turn their heads to look at him he like yourself is a but his characters are beautiful images that lack life he marble figures and attempts to palm them off as flesh and blood he really thinks they are because he has never known the difference if you could take him miss and teach him what love really is the young lady blushed more than before she stammered in a strictly literary way he explained but he added thinking he was getting upon the edge of a we must not forget the object of my visit he took the parcel containing her that he had obtained from mr and began to the string he soon had it in a hard knot and miss to his rescue her young hands touched his and made his heart beat faster there she said when the knot had given way to their joint it is all right now but before we begin on this tell me a little more about mr what has he written where was it a tis published i will send to morrow morning and buy a copy her enthusiasm was agreeable under the circumstances but the truth had to be explained to her what he has written i will let you see one of these days he replied as for he ran upon the same rock that you did that of mr the beautiful eyes opened wider so he rejected his work too and yet you say that it was well done exquisitely s lines are as as his face and figure ,1,Arthur Conan Doyle

of but you seem to have no trouble about it i asked him why i should have and he answered that most people do perhaps that is because they feel a responsibility about the future that i don t i returned i don t the of a saint think i can alter what is to come after death and i don t see what possible good i can do by about it father brought me up you know to feel that i had all i could attend to in making the best i can of this life without wasting my strength in about another in any case i can t see why i should be any more afraid of death than i am of sleep i understand one as well as i do the other he looked at the rug thoughtfully a moment and then as if he declined to be drawn into an argument he came back to the original subject of our talk would tom want to have anything to do with the child he asked i think he would rather forget she is in the world i told him by and by he may be fond of her but now he tries not to think of her at all i want to make her so attractive and lovely he can t help caring for her but then she will care for him the commented why of course she will that is what i hope then she might influence him and help him you are willing to share her with her father even if you do adopt her he asked i did not understand his manner but i told him i did not think i had any right to deprive her of her father s affection or him of hers if i adopted her a dozen times over the made no answer his face was graver and for some time we sat without further word tom is n t as bad as he seems miss daniel said at length if you had to live with his mother i guess you d be ready to excuse him for most anything his father never had june the to say to a goose and mrs has him from the time we were boys he s as good as a man can be but it s a pity he don t carry out paul s idea of being ruler in his own house paul was a bachelor like you daniel i answered rather and neither of you knows anything about it he grinned but only added that tom had been into most of his i m not him he went on apparently afraid that he should seem to be but there s a good deal to be said for him aunt says he ought to be driven out of decent society but tom never did a mean thing in his life i was rather surprised to hear this from but i certainly agreed with him tom s sin makes me but i realize that i m not capable of judging him and he certainly has a good deal of excuse for whatever evil he has fallen into june one thing more which said has made me think a good deal he asked me what tom had meant to do about the child if its mother lived i told him had been willing for me to have baby in any case he thought in silence a moment i don t believe he said tom ever meant to live with that woman he must have married her to clear his conscience he married her so the child should not be disgraced i answered daniel looked at me with those great keen eyes glowing beneath his shaggy white brows the of a saint then he went pretty far toward clearing his record was his comment there are not many men have tied themselves to such a wife for the sake of a child this was not very perhaps but a good heart will get the better of now and then it has set me to thinking about tom and his wife in a way which had not occurred to me i wonder if it is true that he did not mean to live with her i remember now that he said he would never see again but at the time this meant nothing to me if he had thought of making a home he would naturally expect to have his child but after all i doubt if at that time he considered anything except the good of baby he did not love her he had not even looked at her but he tried to do her right as far as he could he give her an honest name in the eyes of the world but he must have known that he could not make a home with where the surroundings would be good for a child this must have been what he considered for the moment yet tom is one who thinks out things and he may have thought out the future of the mother too when i look back i wonder how it was i consented so quickly to take i wanted to help tom and i wanted him to be able to decide without being forced by any consideration of baby i do not know whether he ought to have married for her own sake if she had lived i am afraid i should have been tempted to think he had better not have bound himself to her and yet i realize that i should have been disappointed in him if he had decided not to do it i doubt if i could have got rid entirely of the feeling that somehow he would have june been cowardly i wonder if he had any notion of my feeling he came out of the trial nobly at least and i honor him with all ,3,Charles Dickens

fact in itself make my friendship a thing you would desire to end the clock in the office loudly while mr was forming his reply in itself no he said at last i do not pretend to the morals of my

least affection good god cried mr sharply which was true to the life of my dearly loved father threatened hy any resistance to his will i had consented to have the ceremony performed after telling both mrs and that i should never let it be anything more than a string of words but when i met the lady whom you saw the first real passion of my heart sprang up and overwhelmed me i saw that to carry out my promise in america was to condemn myself to a lifetime of misery and i resolved at whatever cost to refuse but when i related the circumstance to margaret to mrs i mean she saw the matter in a light that i could not have expected admitting that she loved me that i was dearer to her than all else she declared that she would not step between me and the woman to whom i was engaged she was an orphan recently become so and nearly she had no relations to whom she could go and her future had not a single ray of sunlight in it unless she became my wife still no argument that i could make had

disastrous as could be conceived having determined that she could not would not marry me and that she never would love another this strange girl lived as my wife for the next fortnight under the

into the when visiting mrs he therefore dressed himself with great care and proceeded in a to where the old dwelt her abode was scarcely a flat in the accepted sense of the word but rather a collection of rooms on the first floor of a fine old mansion in street a retired butler and his wife who had been a cook owned the house and attended to the various people who dwelt therein mrs was thus spared the trouble of domestic details for which â as she said herself â she had no head and was very comfortably placed at a moderate charge with the obstinacy of old age she called her abode my

iron on entering the door from the staircase three narrow windows could be seen opposite opening on to a small balcony but as the night was a trifle cold these were closed and the yellow curtains were drawn the room looked comfortable and mrs was the most comfortable person in it she fitted the apartment as a fits its shell the with a great sense of the fitness of things had grown old gracefully â that is she had not resorted to and paint to improve her looks she was a â woman and very stout but her dignity was tremendous in a black velvet gown trimmed with lace that might or might not have been with her silvery hair worn in the style of with a somewhat massive set of features by a gracious smile mrs received her guest as a queen might have done from a long experience in playing aristocratic old in comedy and imperious in tragedy dignity had become a second nature to the clever old it is said that was so long in writing the decline and fall that he ended in believing himself to be the roman empire in a like manner mrs believed herself to be the in caste or or â perhaps a mixture of the three she certainly was dignified and no stage manager ever dare to take a liberty with

hand to be shaken or kissed as the visitor preferred having something to gain from a little flattery kissed the fingers he knew that this old world attention appealed to mrs as nothing else did you

attitude â also noticed by critics oh no no i am but a humble of the past and you have survived to show us what grace and dignity once existed the old fluttered her fan with a gracious smile and bowed her head to the compliment neither grace nor dignity are necessary in this age of cars she said sighing however we must take things as they are and be cheerful you don t ask after charity i am too much taken up with you at present madam ah you with your well charity is in the dining room with ir she is showing him some new photographs of herself so will not be here for a few minutes which is

closely veiled and plainly dressed in some dark material it would not do for her to attract attention seeing that england was ringing with the murder of which she was accused and with her strange escape lee s mate proved to be a very pleasant little man who confided to that had told him all and that he did not believe in the guilt of his passenger for one moment she s as pretty as a picture and as true as steel and as innocent as a dove said the poetical captain and if that beast hurts her well then ril have him on board the and do for him after which with a nod he departed the lovers

impulse then as in a looking glass cried mrs wonderful here indeed is material for a new comedy of errors i the sealed message chapter xviii i he first marriage mrs might well exclaim and were silent from sheer amazement even though the first might have expected to see one girl the double of the other in that box of an office and in the some what dim light that through the dingy window and appeared to be exactly alike miss bird was also plainly dressed in a dark frock so as not to attract attention from s clerks and this along with the thrown back completed the resemblance the two girls had similar eyes and hair and complexion and cast of face and even mrs found it difficult to distinguish one from the other long as she had known her adopted daughter it is like a dream she declared â in real life oh that i were in management again what a chance for a play a serious play which has to do with we are engaged in is serious enough said sitting down my dear this is mrs who is going to take charge of you until we can prove your innocence shook hands with the old and you don t believe that i am guilty she asked in a whisper for answer mrs embraced and kissed her my dear she said truth looks out of your eyes out of my eyes i think said charity mr this is really amazing i never thought to find my double it seems you will be marrying â instead of me the sealed message no said slowly and looking from one girl to the other there is a difference meaning that is more charming than i am thank you oh no broke in miss i am only an ignorant country girl but you are clever and polished and and quite perfect ended charity kissing as mrs had done and with the same kindness let us hope that i am in s eyes this is he is to be my husband at last gasped displayed impatience had we not better get to business he observed these girls are so alike that i don t want them to be seen together lest trouble comes of it and trouble will come said mrs who had not yet got over her amazement as charity says this line for line resemblance is i hope your are thick enough my if anyone saw you two together the wonderful resemblance would certainly be commented upon and might get to major s ears charity looked long and earnestly at we must be sisters can you remember ever having a sister no nor did major ever say that i had one he brought me as he said from some time after my mother died and ever since i have been shut up in the s house i was bom at said charity thoughtfully at least the who sold me to the s wife declared that i was i don t remember anything about it of course mother the sealed message oh don t ask my dear i can explain nothing you know what i know and it is strange that both you and should have been bom in india that fact and the resemblance

they were living under the same roof as one might say in one family it is strange she added that he never spoke of her in any of his letters it flashed across s mind at this moment that it was who suggested the engagement of miss and a of doubt took possession of his brain he may not have thought it of enough consequence he replied trying to crush the unpleasant feeling i did not know there was

which in every age have ventured all the bright capital of life in vague speculations and romantic dreams what could it be but the ship that haunts the sea forever and with all sails set drives onward before a ceaseless gale and is not hailed nor ever comes to port know the ship is always full i know the still watches at the for the lost and still the believes that is at hand upon his quest the still asks where he is going and the pale youth knows that he shall never fly himself yet they would gladly that wild chase and the dear dreams of years could they find what i have never lost they were ready to follow the poet home if he would have told them where it lay i know where it lies i breathe the soft air of the purple which they shall never tread i hear the sweet music of the voices they long for in vain i am no traveller my only voyage is to the office and home again william and john and charles sail to europe and the south but i defy their romantic distances when the spring comes and the flowers blow i drift through the year with summer and with with the changing months i keep high in all the i sit at home and walk with and if the sun that the sap in me the wish to i

winds blow fiercely and the and the thought of lost and of perilous voyages touches the soft heart of i hear a voice sweeter to my ear than that of the to the tempest tossed sailor r thank god your only is in the flying i family portraits look upon this picture and k we have no family pictures and i only a portrait of my grandmother hangs upon out parlor wall it was taken at least a century ago and represents the venerable lady whom i remember in my childhood in spectacles and comely cap as a young and blooming girl she is sitting upon an old fashioned sofa by the side of a aunt of hers and with her back to the open window her costume is quaint but handsome it is a cream colored dress made high in the throat ruffled around the neck and over the bosom and shoulders the waist is just under her shoulders and the sleeves are tight than any of our coat sleeves and also ruffled at the wrist around the plump and rosy neck which i remember as and sallow and hidden under a decent lace handkerchief hangs in the picture a of large beads there are two curls upon the forehead and the rest of the hair flows away in down the neck the hands hold an open book the eyes look up from it with tranquil sweetness and through the open window behind you see a quiet landscape â a hill a tree the glimpse of a river and a few peaceful summer clouds often in my younger days when my grandmother sat by the fire after dinner lost in thought â perhaps remembering the time when the picture was really a portrait â i have curiously compared her wasted face with the blooming beauty of the girl and tried to detect the likeness it was strange how the resemblance would sometimes start out how as i gazed and gazed upon her old face age disappeared before my eager glance as snow in the sunshine revealing the flowers of a forgotten spring it was touching to see my grandmother steal quietly up to her portrait on still summer mornings when every one had left the house â and i the only child played disregarded â and look at it wistfully and long she held her hand over her eyes to shade aa them from the light that streamed in at the window and i have seen her stand at least a quarter of an hour gazing at the picture she said nothing she made no motion she shed no tear but when she turned away there was always a pensive sweetness in her face that made it not less lovely than the face of her youth i have learned since what her thoughts must have been â how that long wistful glance time and space how forms and faces unknown to any er arose in sudden around her â that i shall never hear how many a game that i shall never play how many a song that i shall never sing were all renewed and remembered as my grandmother contemplated her picture i often stand as she stood gazing earnestly at the picture so long and so silently that looks up from her work and says she shall be jealous of that beautiful my grandmother who yet makes her think more kindly of those remote old times yes and that is the charm of a family portrait yes again but says when he hears the remark how if one s grandmother were a a a ah in that case â i am compelled to say while looks up again half and i add gravely â you for instance then smiles one of his sad smiles and we change the subject yet i am always glad when our neighbor who knows that my opportunities are few comes to ask me to step round and see the family portraits the i think are a very old family says they date from the but i thought people of english descent preferred to stop with william the conqueror who came from france before

he was a law unto himself and the particular scandal into which he had got himself wa one which chanced to touch the squire in a particularly delicate spot the squire had not sent for to come to him without having in his a s which he intended to propose to the lad he stood in place of father and mother to the young man and was wholly dependent on him for money so that the squire might be excused for feeling that he had a right to speak in this crisis he had made up his stupid old mind that the thing for to do and the only thing which could save his nephew from destruction was for the to marry all his life the squire had heard the phrase marry and settle down until he had come to regard the two things as inseparable and to feel that the man who married was thereby settled down whatever might be his natural to that result he sent for to come to him and he made up miss jane his mind that this time he would not be he would not allow the young to his anger as he had so often done he would be firm and and there should be no down from the decision he had reached was plainly going to the dogs and he must see to it that a catastrophe was prevented when arrived and the squire presented to him his scheme the young received the proposition with shouts of laughter which was the worst thing he could have done since he thereby touched his uncle s vanity and made him indignant personally as well as in the interests of the highest morality the gentleman was brought to the point of informing the who at him that not one penny more should the latter receive from him until he was engaged to be married and to this determination he stuck with a decision which was so new that became at last filled with consternation wondering to what length this thing would go it was not unnatural that the young gentleman should be he had a lot of debts to pay and he had plans for the rest of the summer which it needed con in the bundle of time money to carry out he had no resource outside of his uncle and if the old gentleman persisted in this and notion did not see just how the remainder of the season could prove anything but extremely unpleasant to him there were higher and harder words between uncle and nephew than there had ever been before and every syllable which was said on either side confirmed the old squire in the belief that he must be since upon him the whole of s future depended it was only natural that spoiled as he was should be much vexed over the whole affair he had been annoyed enough at the scandal which led to this quarrel and now that he was cut off from supplies and forced to in the attitude of a his naturally easy temper was more ruffled than it had ever been in the whole course of his existence before he upon the situation until the morning when miss jane came to hem the new muslin curtains for the parlor and then he had a bright idea he came down to his breakfast at the hour which in itself was regarded by the villagers all duly informed concerning it as of miss jane and after the meal was disposed of he sauntered out on to the where miss jane sat sewing in the village there was nothing in the fact that miss jane went out sewing to interfere with her social standing and indeed since it was known that it was not absolutely necessary that she should do it it conferred upon her a certain distinction she was looked upon as if she were a person of so much leisure that she could go visiting day after day and the mere fact that her visits were paid for did not from her social rank miss jane greeted with coolness and with a certain air of dry which amused him he stretched himself in the which was in itself an article of sufficient in the village and lay there watching her as she in the warm june how tired you must get of sticking that needle in and pulling it out again he observed at length not half so tired as you must get of doing nothing she retorted smiled and regarded her closely miss jane was not a beauty and neither her nor her habit of her in the bundle of time chin had any tendency to make her more fascinating she was half a dozen years older than and she had nothing in her appearance to contradict an assertion that she was ten years his senior looked at her from his amused at her and then it was that he had an idea so forcibly did it strike him that he almost called out in glee but he was able so far to control his emotions as to confine himself to a laugh which was too musical not to be delightful you are severe on me he said beginning with unusual to put into execution at once his suddenly formed scheme this is my you know i should think you would need it miss jane sewing more swiftly laughed more than ever you folk down here ,3,Charles Dickens

this morning and whether her dress is a mass of and and marvellous which when extravagant upon the form of an elder woman always remind me of of distress hung out upon a craft that is drifting far away from the enchanted of youth is it the instinctive effort to the brilliancy of youth that the advancing woman to herself so brightly is it the involuntary hope that she will really seem to be and gay of heart if only her dress be gay as they go by i mark that richly and i recall the days when i was merely an of the and when in the modest parlor in bond street she sang i walk in silk attire nor

withdraw and to look out at another a window and to make your own comments instead of his but that was not exactly what i had in mind as i watched this pretty procession resumed the venerable but the truth is that when i see a crowd of brightly dressed women my mind as it were and i am very apt not to hit my mark the old gentleman smiled again all the fine spring of sunday do not prove the youth of every face under them and i wonder whether this splendid of means that you are a more religious people than in the days that i is the sincerity of religious feeling always in proportion to the magnificence of the if it be you have become a deeply religious people especially in your great city we used to think at the in rome that the people of that city were in danger of a punctual of religious ceremonies for religion but you are so intelligent that you are of course in no such danger i accept these beautiful flowers and this pretty â procession of new as the proof of your religious progress the paused a moment and then continued you send a great many to india and elsewhere is it because you have no work for them at home in my country my and heathen we have a proverb that an of practice is worth a pound of profession in rome i say we used to fear lest the people with and and and of a long series of and and penance and many ceremonies might come to confound these things with religion but i suppose that this this solemn from the german in lent and this interest in and mean that you devote the same energy and time and care to studying how to help the helpless how to console the suffering how to teach poverty to hope and labor for its own relief it means that the richly attired christians who are walking in the most fashionable spring to church on sun day have learned who is their neighbor and what their duty is towards him and are diligently doing it the removed his and turned to smile upon the group of club men near him this reflection he continued makes me very happy and fills me with reverence for a christian people for if you built superb churches in one street and heathen of soul and body in the next street you would christianity no no these sweet flowers of are not of your words but of your work not of our professions but of your practice the old gentleman resumed his glasses and looked silently at the thronged street how comfortable to believe with our venerable friend and to perceive that the great increase in the beauty of the is the fitting symbol of the corresponding increase in our religious faith and practice t is many years

to have something of importance to communicate and miss took occasion to express her doubts as to whether some people knew quite as many secrets as they wished others to infer i have heard a said mr that mr is married oh that s not possible i cried miss i am sure miss would not encourage him so openly if he were i don t see that she him at all put in miss keeping a man waiting eight years is hardly what i should call giving him much encouragement i presume he only comes the same as other men who attend her remarked mr who seemed to have developed a sudden interest in the conversation it is not necessary i suppose that she should promise to marry every man whom she here ah but it is quite another affair responded miss i thought everybody knew that mr was on special terms the rest of you come on and sundays at t husband s friend hour but there is no hour nor day to which is he is the most intimate friend miss has in the world much more intimate than mrs st john there with all her talk about dear she threw a glance not wholly free from spite in the direction of the lady referred to for which miss mentally thanked her you surprise me said mr this intimacy you say has been going on for years r undoubtedly and it causes no talk miss surveyed her with a look of the amazement talk she exclaimed talk of mr was crushed mr drew a deep breath of relief and left the group a number of new turned the conversation nd before they had finished their mutual greetings miss herself entered the room there are people whom it is difficult to describe with pen and paper and was certainly one of them it is easy to say that she was a little under the medium height of slender build neither dark nor fair and twenty eight years of age but so were a thousand other women in boston that night she had no especial in dress or speech her garments were plain almost to excess she wore no whatever and her manners were most the only thing that distinguished her especially was the extreme and whiteness of her hands which were almost transparent they had a highly nervous quality that might hare at home delighted one skilled in the science of and even to the ordinary observer they indicated a highly sensitive with perhaps a delicacy of constitution why easily any assembly of which she became a part nobody could tell that she did it nobody pretended to deny one by one she took her guests by the hand and said her simple words of welcome mrs st john took up a position at her side and introduced those who attended the reception for the first time with a question or two and a smile she won the heart of each visitor before she turned to the next when she had greeted every one she sought out mr george and they had a quiet talk together which no one else was privileged to hear i have been wondering why it is that you interest me so much she said to him after awhile and i have discovered it at last your manner of stating things reminds me of a friend who is now on his travels mr but am a married man responded son instantly it was rude undoubtedly it was rude but politeness was not a virtue that he placed above all others and he wanted to know then and there whether the suspicion of mr was true he had never seen in his life he had known miss but a month but it seemed to him that all worth having in this world and the far beyond on the answer to that question miss gave no evidence of having heard his a lady who had just entered the room smiled at her and she excused herself with charming sweetness to cross the carpet raged husband s inwardly as he saw how easily she had him and rose impatiently to meet mrs st john who was to see him you like miss don t you she said very much he replied but in saying this he at that moment he almost hated her and to save his life he could not have given a reason i knew you would like her when i brought you here continued the self satisfied lady she likes you too it is not often i assure you that sits down alone with any gentleman as she did with you except he said a oh well that is a different thing said mrs st john they own a magazine together and and there are various reasons why she treats him differently from the rest but likes you and i know it she asked me yesterday if you were certain to be here to night the sulky fit was on him and he tore himself from the woman as soon as he could do so he did

mastery of the was a powerful in securing her regard he was always ready to amuse her and the dwarf s chamber humour her so that the little creature soon became fondly attached to one possessed of so many for winning her regard towards on the other hand madam conducted herself with the utmost and was more frank than pleasant in her speeches the mere idea that he was to succeed her brother and become master of the house threw her into fits of anger which her for days the little woman was highly and trifles which would have hardly disturbed a person roused her to frenzy who was as a creature as could be met with offended her greatly by his want of tact and his coarse jokes on her consequently she requested her brother not to let him visit her portion of the house when staying at the and had not set eyes on the for over three years it was therefore with some surprise that who knew her great aunt s aversion to the young man was requested by madam to bring to see her that afternoon he will only make you ill gently oh no oh dear dear no replied madam with shrill disdain not now my love once upon a time such would have been the case no doubt but now i can afford to laugh at his how so more than on former occasions you are asking me to betray the secrets of the good people said the dwarf in a tone of reproof not until the moon is full am i permitted to reveal that which i know then my love you will see â the coarse creature â tumbled down from his high estate oh yes i know what i know the peaceful neighbours are not to be insulted with child out of all this could extract no

it was difficult to say but in making the request she evidently had some purpose which was to the dwarf had a great deal of in her character and when provoked by any one as in the present instance she would make herself uncommonly disagreeable foresaw that would have a bad quarter of an hour should he accept the invitation expressed himself quite ready to do so but made so many contemptuous remarks concerning the unfortunate little being that who was strongly attached to her great aunt remonstrated with him on his painful you must remember said she that you of all men have the least right to sneer at her why so my fair cousin because you are of our blood and when you marry may have children likewise afflicted if i did i d kill them said in strong disgust all those little should be drowned like at their birth they are not human beings i hope when you succeed my grandfather you will your brutal determination said angrily you know that for generations our family has produced and as you being of our blood will not be from the burden it is only right and just that you should bear it as our forefathers have done if you take the title and estates you have a right to take the trouble

fault you ever found with a woman was her to become a mother in the time you will not she be even less willing to assume that position listened intently i wondered what they could be thinking of to utter such in her presence but they seemed to say them not only in spite of her being there but for her special benefit women will be honest when that time comes said and honesty is the chief of all virtues it seems to me the that to day is simply horrible women and men enter into a marriage contract in which certain things are and others understood then one of them deliberately with malice as the say sets to work to deceive the other in a point of first importance in other words she and her partner as no one would think of doing in any other business that is the way to make the world honest is to give woman greater freedom take away the to falsehood and she will rise above the petty that she now i do not blame you for me i cannot defend myself for my conduct toward mrs except on the principle by which we meet a with any weapon that is convenient when i discovered her deception i felt insulted robbed outraged i acted as a man driven wild is liable to act woman make her free and such questions cannot arise it will be for her to say whether she will be a mother and no man can question her an artificial rule decision to day she enters into a contract which common honesty requires her to keep and a contract by two persons cannot be broken at the whim of one of them without danger of protest when the discovery is made then he turned abruptly to my consternation and put this inquiry to what do you think about it dear the girl raised her sweet eyes to her father i don t know as i can tell you exactly she said i am sure i am almost sure at least that never shall marry and yet you told us a little while ago exclaimed mrs drew that it was the hope of your life to have a child of your own yes said softly turning her slow gaze toward the speaker it was with one movement that we looked at surely he would protest with vigor when he heard this home assumption of the doctrine he had been advancing but he only the hair of the daughter who was dearer than life to him and smiled at her with the same affectionate gaze chapter xiv an artificial rule i do not want to make my story more than is absolutely necessary to show you the way in which the central idea of miss s life out of was formed and grew until it controlled her actions most of us are what our and have made us the thoughts that fill our brains have not come there at random they are the product of what we have seen and heard and read combined with our natural and inherited and inclinations under other circumstances this girl would never have entertained the dreams that now influenced her under still other but different ones she would have had them by the counsels of those set to be her teachers and in order to understand how she has come to her present in spite of the world and has even had the courage to act upon them you must know each step she took on that strange path had loved his child from her birth indeed as he himself said to me more than once from a time long to it as she grew to woman s estate this love deepened into adoration whatever did was right her conduct must not be questioned he would have fought the universe for her sake convinced that a of opinion was worthless if it opposed hers in return she gave him the fullest confidence and veneration they talked together more like brother and sister husband and wife if you will than father and daughter he had never drawn any line that she feared to pass she asked him every question that came into her head as freely as if he were her mother and physician combined when reached the age of eighteen she began a study of medicine she seized upon its revelations with the of a young dr asked her if aw artificial she intended to practice and try to take his away from him he was astonished at the things she learned in an brief space of time she devoured the text books as if they were and clung to volumes of lectures with all the delight usually shown for a romance at the end of a year she triumphantly announced to the good physician that she knew as much as he in relation to one of the greatest problems of life and yet she added thoughtfully i know no more than every woman ought to know i have only got

to me in addition to any professional satisfaction if i can put you into the comfortable circumstances for which your nature is so well adapted there is no reason why you should fight your way in a cold and cruel world when ease and comfort may be yours at the same time there is as you must guess a feature to this marriage that you might prefer did not exist when you hear what it is do not into a state of excitement but deliberate on the matter calmly the chance is one that will not be likely to occur again in your lifetime it is yours to accept or reject and the opportunity is for to night only into the brain of the young man there came the most preposterous reasons as possible ones in this strange affair but nothing agreeing with mr statements could be found that seemed in the least degree go on he said himself for the revelation it is this said mr slowly and distinctly the young lady if she becomes your wife will probably present you with an heir within a period somewhat less than that ordinarily expected in such cases c astray chapter viii a very blunt refusal the first impression of mr gray was to strike the man who coolly uttered these words which he felt contained a burning insult to himself the next idea was to open the carriage door and spring to the ground himself of a companion capable of such an outrage but before he could execute either of these things a overcame him and he lay back against the carriage cushions helpless it was as if he had been offered a drink of cool water and had found a bitter and draught when the cup was pressed to his lips this it was that stood between him and this i did not suppose it would be agreeable to you pursued the quiet voice of the in itself it bears a harsh front but as an alternative proposition it looks somewhat different the young lady of whom i speak has made one slip which may be kept from the knowledge of the world with the exception of a moment of madness for which even she cannot account she has i am sure led a pure and creditable life there were only two persons to whom she dared confide her grief and the pain it would give to either of them i leave you to imagine to her mother already in delicate health it might mean instant death to her father a man of the highest reputation and as jealous of his honor as one a blunt refusal can conceive it must be a blow compared to which there is no other conceivable he has brought her up delicately with the best of teachers as free apparently from danger of this kind as an angel in paradise her mother has been her most constant friend and the girl had never shown the least partiality for the opposite sex so far as they knew nevertheless the deed was done and when she went in terror to this father and told him the truth he came at once to me i being his legal adviser i have never seen a human being in such mental agony in spite of himself mr gray was listening and with the deepest interest to this remarkable story he began even to excuse the for the part he had taken in him into this net from which he would presently make good his escape aged ten years in one hour continued mr this old man told me as men tell things to lawyers and to priests of the curse that had fallen on his house as was my duty i tried to the effects of the injury by suggesting ways to lessen the force of the blow i said we could take the guilty one in hand and make him right his wrong as far as was possible at the marriage altar to this the father responded in the most vehement manner that he would rather see his child in her grave and himself with her than to own as a son in law a wretch who had such a crime against them he believed the fellow had proceeded deliberately with this expectation in view and had hoped to attain by to a position he could never reach in a straightforward and honest manner love gone astray the father disposed of him in one torrent of and i saw that further talk on that score was useless even had i thought from my own after what i knew that it was advisable the carriage was approaching mr home and he called to the driver to make a to the journey he then looked narrowly at young gray who lay quite still to see if he was paying attention and finding that he was proceeded cautiously as if addressing a jury on whose verdict his entire case depended there was another proposition at which i vaguely hinted and which i was relieved to have rejected as quickly as the first i found a good deal of determination in this old man in spite of the hurt he had received when we had discussed the matter for several hours he announced his either his daughter should be taken to some secluded place and remain till the birth of her child which he would amply provide for or and this alternative he came to but slowly and by my suggestion she should marry some respectable man who had a full knowledge of her condition and accepted her accordingly in the latter case there must be arranged a pretended marriage of an earlier date while for the public must be prepared the tale of a romance with love at its base something the world always when the nine days wondering is over there was the mother to consider a woman

that must be said the colonel i beg your pardon colonel said the man not seeing the of this observation oh nothing said the colonel only expect a visit to mon ow at twelve o clock from a doubtful clergyman just hang about the lawn on the chance of my giving you a signal thus while was mounting his his victims were preparing in a sort of general way though they did not see their way so clear as the enemy did colonel s drawing room was a magnificent room fifty feet long and thirty feet wide a number of french windows opened on to a noble balcony with three short flights of stone steps leading down to the lawn the central steps were broad the side steps narrow there were four to it two by double doors and two by heavily leading to little rooms at twelve o clock next day what with the burst of color from the flowers on the balcony the white tents and the flags and and a clear day it all the room looked a palace of pleasure and no stranger peeping in could have dreamed that it was the abode of care and about to be visited by gloomy and fraud the first to arrive was with a witness he was received kindly by colonel and ushered into a small room he wanted another witness so john baker was sent for and and he were together reading the deed etc when a footman brought in a card the reverend and written underneath with a pencil in a female hand mrs walter admit them said the colonel firmly at this moment grace who had heard the carriage drive up to the door peeped in through one of the heavy curtains we have mentioned by a perilous secret she actually come said she she has indeed said the colonel looking very grave will you stay and receive her oh no said grace but ril take a good look at her through this curtain i have made a little hole on purpose then she slipped into the little room and drew the curtain the servant opened the door and the false walked in supporting on his arm a dark woman still very beautiful very plainly dressed but well dressed agitated yet self possessed be seated madam said the colonel after a reasonable pause he began to question her you were married on the day of june to a gentleman of the name of walter i was sir may i ask how long you lived with him the lady buried her face in her hands the question took her by surprise and this was a woman s to gain time and answer cleverly but the ingenious gave it a happy turn poor thing i poor thing said he he left me the next day said and i have never seen him since here interposed he fancied he had seen the curtain move excuse me said he i think there is somebody listening and he went swiftly and put his head through the curtain but the room was empty for meantime grace was so surprised by the lady s arrival by her beauty which might well have tempted any man and by her air of respectability that she changed her directly and she was gone to her father for advice and information in spite of her previous determination not to worry him in his present condition what he said to her can be briefly told elsewhere what he ordered her to do was to return and watch the man and not the woman during s hesitation which was somewhat long a clergyman came to the window looked in and promptly retired seeing the colonel had company this however was only a modest a he saw in half a moment that this must be mark s but as the police like to go their own way he would not watch the lawn himself but asked with whom he had made acquaintance to keep an eye upon that with his fellows for there was a jail bird in the house then he went round to the front door by which he felt sure his bird would make his exit he had no earthly right to capture this but he was prepared if the colonel who was a magistrate gave him the order and not without but we are interrupting colonel s madam what makes you think this person was my son indeed sir i don t know said the lady and looking around the room with some signs of distress i begin to hope it was not your son he was a tall young man almost as tall as yourself he was very handsome with brown hair and brown eyes and seemed incapable of deceit have you any letters of his asked the colonel i had a great many sir said she but i have not kept them all have you one said the colonel sternly oh yes sir said i think i must have nearer twenty but what good will they be said she affecting simplicity why my dear madam said colonel is quite right the handwriting may not tell you anything but surely his own father knows it i think he is offering you a very fair test i must tell you plainly that if you don t produce the letters you say you possess i shall by a perilous secret regret having put myself forward in this matter at all gently sir said the colonel she has not refused to produce them put her hand in her pocket and drew out a packet of letters but she hesitated and looked timidly at after his late severity am i bound to part with them certainly not said but you can surely trust them for a minute to such a man as colonel i

had heard all that william and could tell her of what had passed upstairs was in a nervous state lest the she was preparing should be returned as unsatisfactory but had exhausted for the moment his love of lots at fun and ate his supper which was really very good without comment when it was finished he walked the to watch the stars which shone brightly over the still mountain and valley and in the pleasure of the contemplation forgot his loneliness foi the time his uncle was away on business when he arrived at but returned within a day or two and came promptly to the hotel noticed as he had in the interview at new york that there was something for which he could not account in the manner of this relation he felt that he had in some unknown way displeased him and expected every time mr opened his mouth to learn the cause of his changed attitude he feared that he had delayed too long to suit his uncle s ideas in deciding what to adopt as a profession but he had become so used to doing nothing that he did not like the thought of giving it up though the conversation lasted for more than an hour however it bore no reference to this subject it ran backward and forward at random among things native and foreign and not a word was spoken conveying the least hint that anything disagreeable was in mind could not help wondering whether he had alarmed himself could it be that his busy uncle was willing he should lead a life of entire idleness i hope they make things agreeable for you here said mr after one of his long pauses quite so responded having miss is shocked in countries where the manners are so entirely different things seem a little odd at first but is doing the best he can the elder man seemed relieved at the answer i live so plainly myself said he that i fear you would not be comfortable at my house however some day before you go if you would like to come for a dinner i i could arrange it that is of course with time for preparation laughed lightly that sounds awfully formal said he i would be glad to take pot luck with you but the hotel is just as well when you get a chance you might come in and dine with me and save all the trouble i will do that then responded the other drawing a long breath on the whole it would be better yes he added it would be much better although mr had dined twice with his nephew after this he had said nothing in relation to the dreaded subject up to the time when he sent the pretty to call him as detailed in the first chapter of this story lots at seventy chapter vi i m sure i can trust you mr had nothing of special moment to communicate to his nephew beyond the message in the words of miss a matter connected with his business had suddenly occurred which made it necessary for him to take a journey that might occupy a fortnight or more he only wished to say good by to and to inquire whether he would probably find him at on his return had this question been asked an hour sooner at any time in fact before he met the charming girl the young man would have answered without hesitation that he would spend the time of his uncle s absence by taking a trip to new york he cordially disliked and remained merely from motives of policy nothing but his interest in the face he had just seen would have kept him there over night but to such a man this reason was amply sufficient he had no idea of leaving a

the chamber into which he conducted them was a small square room witli two strait windows looking down into the of the inn and a single narrow opening opposite through which one might have shot an the chamber o er the gate at an enemy approaching from the street without the place was furnished a couple of beds stood over against the two windows a couple of and a shabby table were placed against the walls while a dingy mirror of glass set in a frame hung between the windows good this is not a apartment said laughing never have i been in so strait quarters before the street would be quarters wider the host returned grimly but on the whole the cheer is better here than there such as it was there was evidently nothing to be done but to make the best of things and when the landlord had lighted their rush candle and himself off the brothers got speedily to bed the noises in the village had largely died away the in the inn itself had subsided and the lay there in silence and a darkness which was lessened only by a ray of light from a lantern set upon a post before the inn which strangely struck through the narrow in the outer wall of the chamber and fell upon the old mirror opposite for a space they were quiet but at length said softly â in the bundle of time art thou awake yea the other answered i am not drowsy but i thought that thou asleep for a moment made no reply then he burst out suddenly he demanded with a trace of in his tone what said the lady to thee this morning there by the trees perchance retorted his brother with sudden bitterness if i tell thee thou wilt say to me in return what thou whispering to her when i came upon thee in the even naught that she was to hear cried angrily good sneered i would not be sure that thou not have been to hear what she said to me by the trees started as if to spring up in bed but controlled himself and lay down again he was stretched out upon his side facing the opposite wall of the room and his eyes were irresistibly attracted by the gleam of light reflected upon the old mirror which hung between the windows for a long time there was silence in the chamber while continued to stare at the mirror the chamber o er the gate thinking angrily of his brother and of the lady suddenly it seemed to him that there was a movement in the dull surface of the mirror there was an appearance of rolling clouds as if masses of luminous up continually from the centre and spread onward toward the edges of the glass he watched it idly thinking of it only as of some upon his tired eyes coming from looking too long until he became aware that the surface of the whole mirror had cleared and that in it he could see reflected the chamber with his brother and himself lying in the two beds he wondered at the clearness of the reflection in a room so dimly lighted but before this wonder could fully shape itself in his mind it gave way to another he seemed in the mirror to see the reflection of slowly and stealthily rising from the bed involuntarily he glanced toward but in his dim corner he was lying quiet without himself moving saw his shadowy semblance in the mirror steal from its place with a caution which was in itself a confession of evil intent he saw it stoop to the stool whereon lay his clothing and take from its belt the dagger cold sweat of fear broke out upon s forehead as he lay there and saw his double in the bundle of time glance toward the sleeping with the fury of a rival in his eyes he gasped his hands so tightly that the nails cut into the palms he said to himself that he was dreaming and yet he knew that he was fully awake he felt as if the dreadful picture on the mirror was painted so plain that all the world might see and he dared not stir lest his brother wake and behold it he grew hot with shame and then cold with fear as he saw pictured before him his own self creeping across the chamber with the stealthy glide of a midnight the dagger clutched with ready hand to strike the and with it all he felt as if ten thousand were urging him to do this very thing which he saw before him hardly could he restrain himself from stealthily gliding out of his bed to seize his dagger and creep toward the couch of as he saw his shadow doing in the glass moreover it seemed to him that this was nothing new but as if it were in some way the of something which was already familiar to him this way of clearing his pathway to the love of the lady â with a sudden horror it flashed upon him the chamber over the gate that it was from the wicked depth of his own mind that this dreadful vision had come he groaned aloud with horrible self and remorse it is â the mirror of thoughts he murmured unconsciously speaking aloud at the word sprang up in his bed it is false it is false he cried out furiously i never thought to murder thee in thy sleep the mirror lies what cried springing up in his turn thou see it also i saw a lie returned in a voice of rage it is an accursed if thou hast seen a vision of me it is a of that witch in the market place a vision of thee echoed what hast thou seen demanded ,3,Charles Dickens

gentleman of wealth high in the political world this daughter whose name is has been like her mother a in one of the great central mills she is a girl of the natural and i can easily trace a family resemblance in your own face now that the relationship is brought to my attention colonel the greatest loss you will sustain in leaving life in this manner is in being deprived of the sight of the pure and noble countenance of a daughter of whom a king might feel proud though prevented by her poverty from receiving the higher forms of education the beauty and sweetness of her spirit make her worthy of any society she is a leader among the who have against our recent attempted cut down of wages living in the manner with no but her innate charm she is the most loved and respected of their the tidings you have confided to me carry with them great cause for sadness on my part for despite the difference in our social rank i have loved almost ever since i have known her as a orphan girl i might in time have won her though thus she has given me little encouragement as the of millions she will be lost tâ me forever colonel was visibly affected speaking of you love my daughter you and you wish tâ marry her yes colonel after living more than thirty years during which i never met a woman who could excite in me warmer feelings than those of friendship won my heart at the first glance tell me what she is like said the colonel lovers are not impartial judges of beauty tried to describe his idol but found the task a difficult one his own enchantment was however made more evident than ever and this was what his was most anxious to prove say you will accept the he said after a pause time is pressing there is no other man tc whom i could leave it with such complete confidence i will do it replied lawyer was then sent for and the will entirely the estate was left to philip esq in trust for daughter of margaret and the to have absolute power to control the principal as he saw fit this will was signed in the presence of the necessary number of witnesses who were called in for the purpose then colonel n asked all to leave the room except the lawyer whom he requested to write as follows from his fifth avenue hotel new york â my dear daughter with but a few hours to live the cause for which others will explain to you i ask your forgiveness and leave you my blessing as a late for my long â â a neglect that gives me the only pang at leaving earth â i have left you all my property in trust with mr his father was for years my intimate friend i also esteem and honor the son

departed from the form but intelligence lingered some moments longer his speech failed but they saw that he wanted to come to the bedside and the wish was at once complied with as their hands were clasped together a pleased smile the transparent whiteness of the colonel s face then the eyes closed and they thought consciousness had fled but they were mistaken a minute later he roused himself looked about the room as if to call on all present to bear him witness and said slowly and distinctly i have asked my daughter to marry mr it was the last of a strong light colonel was dead chapter

i saw him their marriage bond in new york that very evening i ran across him in the street perfectly almost out of his head he had eaten nothing since breakfast i pulled him into a and put a little food and drink into him but he only partially rallied i was afraid to trust him alone i went to his hotel and stayed till morning and after a while i persuaded him to go home to his invalid father that was the only name to influence him with for he worshipped the old gentleman he s never been quite right since and of course the death of his parent has not helped him any i am going to advise mm to see a doctor skilled in mental diseases ordinarily mr would have declined to listen to these statements for he detested gossip but he was so interested in mr s relations to the young woman at his side that he could not resist giving attention margaret on her part bore the well and managed while not losing a word to appear engrossed in some remarks which mr was making was not only married then but his father was dead she knew well why he had wandered half about the avenues of new york on the night that she ran away from him but time had brought things around he had forgotten his mad in season to perform the solemn contract he had entered into with his if he was still sad enough to attract the attention of his friends he had at least done his duty margaret felt a glow of honest pride in the result of her terrible sacrifice and now mr wishes to see the crowning glory of this house cried when the party had left the table and to the parlor mrs may we have the pleasure of showing him your youngest their marriage bond the mother blushed partly with pride and partly from the consciousness that the child s father was known to two of the gentlemen present though perhaps suspected by only one would you really care to see him she asked of the lawyer he is very tiny yet and the old excuse laughed mr won t expect to see a giant in a month old infant oh we must have him brought down there is no excuse for refusal thought as margaret disappeared that perhaps the countenance of the child might give some clue to its but when the baby appeared he saw nothing in the little face that could be used on the witness stand he felt drawn to the child however from the instant he got a view of it a bundle of human flesh with dark eyes and clenched fists this was the way it presented itself before his bachelor vision and yet it was a whose existence might be of the utmost importance to the world whom does he resemble asked much amused at the manner in which mr surveyed it not his mamma i think probably being a boy he is more like he stopped before he had said his father for the pained look in margaret s eyes told him he had again on feelings which were very tender i don t think he looks like anybody yet said margaret in a musical tone he looks just like himself that s all which is quite enough interposed mrs in a bit of womanly instinct he is the very best baby i ever

depart and only waiting to bid farewell to her she gave her hand to both gentlemen to mr first in the palm was a piece of paper which with the motion she transferred from her hand to his usually slow to comprehend secret actions the lawyer had sufficient presence of mind to retain the paper without revealing the transaction by his manner and he slipped it into his coat pocket at the first opportunity as soon as possible after leaving his companion he read the words on the paper my dear sir you are a and i believe an honest man i wish to see you on important business and shall try to come to your office within a few days please give no hint of this to any one and do not write to me as i have no and a letter would attract attention yours m t their marriage bond a face in the mr read this letter with mingled feelings he had not cared to question mr as to the manner in which the latter made the acquaintance of the young mother nor as to how long he had known her it was certainly strange enough to discover her in the party with whom he had heen invited to dine when had the city and had wandered for nights together according to his story in a fruitless search and here she was not only in a pleasant home instead of starving in some but on the most friendly terms with a man who visited very often much too often thought at mr s residence there was still much of mystery left who paid the bills which counting her recent trial must have been substantial ones if mr did only one could be entertained was not noted as a money did not leave his pocket without

the s p men of no dramatic nor even talent to steal plays and sell them the knowing any fool can do it propose to themselves to get the stolen goods for nothing they work in two classes the second rate theatres three of the whole pay some low to steal them a french piece it fifty nights which is â per night for the gas the the actors the the rent cost the manager say a night the work of art to play which the actors mouth and to set ofi which the painters paint and the fiddle costs â per night thus does the english profit by the french author god is just to if we are not and does not smile on those who men of merit merely because they are in england what he was in s tent the respectable manager in larger figures and drives a more complicated bargain but quite as keen and silly a one he gives il for a stolen piece but to whom in most cases to a that french pieces this is one of a a gang of and judges sworn to mutual protection and to if possible all under the apparent bargain then lies the real bargain an of between a and a fence for the piece t e l for the frenchman s intellect and for the englishman s and his the thing is too notorious to require however here is an independent witness for you â chambers journal july he sees the true relation between the london dramatic author and the critic of the daily paper and sometimes to find them one and most of our play and farce writers are on the press and a shrewd manager takes care to select his authors accordingly knowing that they form a of which each member is bound to puff the other s production because all in their turn need a similar favour t e a seldom get a piece accepted but when they do what a of criticism they have to run this is a theatres limited by tyranny number of writers limited by conspiracy most the eighth would buy the press if they could and high but they cannot indirectly the manager can hence it is that london theatrical criticism in fraud and corruption like a in a its impudent is not of our age it is what political criticism used to be under and and for the same cause and so the public is and english genius excluded from the stage and the dramatic art pines for want of honest criticism etc for though this artificial up of art by praise what mr chambers is polite enough to call shrewd men yet wise and well read men know by the history of the arts that under this protection they always lose their popularity through declining in merit shrewd indeed i to lay down their sick man under the shelter of the tree all this the removal of the would cure by slow degrees fences prices which cannot exist in trade hit hy crime would be that mean fraud and the false and scale of which has shocked every upright mind and feeling heart would receive its death blow in england the tailor who cuts is paid more than the who his work and in france the author draws about one tenth of the of the theatre that plays his piece at fifteen london theatres out of twenty he draws about one five of the nightly of his play yet the far better in paris than here hence i infer that looks upon an author and his dependent family as human though these brutes do not compelled to buy from france instead of stealing the would cease to narrow their by closing those few theatres to original english talent they would no longer play french pieces rather than read an original ms which is the case now they would select the french plays and pay for them such a price as the poor english might just manage to with without dying of absolute starvation and they would not play quite

use of the family circle io the silent house for the next day or two mused over the information he had obtained and made a fresh drawing of the plan for his own satisfaction but he took no steps on this new evidence as he was anxious to submit his discoveries to miss before doing so at the present time was at bath taking possession of her acres and consulting the family lawyer on various matters connected with the property once she wrote to him that she had heard several pieces of news likely to be useful in clearing up the mystery but these she refused to communicate save at a personal interview was thus kept in suspense and unable to rest until he knew precisely the value of miss s newly acquired information therefore it was with a feeling of relief that he received a note from her asking him to call at three o clock on sunday at the royal john hotel since her going and coming a week had elapsed now that his divinity had returned and he was about to see her again the sun shone

silent house her turn and gave her hand to the with a new bom timidity she also was inclined to like more than was reasonable for the peace of her heart so these two people each drawn to the other should have come together as lovers even at this second meeting but alas for the of this world they had to assume the attitudes of lawyer and and discourse of crime instead of love the situation was a

guilty i chapter xiii gossip going by evidence certainly had good grounds to accuse mrs of committing the crime for there were four points at least which could be proved past all doubt as her strongly in the matter in the first place the female shadow on the blind seen by showed that a woman had been in the habit of entering the house by the secret way of the cellar and during the absence of

that the weapon had been removed to london and used to commit the deed seeing that otherwise there was no necessity for its presence in the square mansion had discovered that had spent the night of

the train was starting wrung his companion s hand so sharply that he bruised it and with a hasty good by left him alone caught in thb act chapter xiv caught in the act for various reasons nearly a fortnight elapsed after the meeting which had with in his uncle s library before he accepted her invitation to enter the grounds late at night she had not been as well as usual for one thing and her mother had remained with her a good deal the impatient lover was obliged to content himself with the daily that contrived to to him and he thought than ever during the days after s departure at last however a time was set for the long delayed meeting he was to wait near the wall door at the rear of the mansion until after had seen mr s light extinguished and was sure tom had finished his game of and gone home the habits of the household as the girl knew from experience were very clock like mr seldom remained long out of bed after the departure of his regular visitor having allowed a half hour from the time she saw the light put out sent to find the anxious all the innumerable adventures which the young man had experienced seemed to pale into in comparison with this one he had climbed j love at seventy by a to the window of a wealthy beauty in had been disguised into the of a great official of had barely escaped with his life from an husband in but this possessed a strangeness equalled by none of the others to be around the walls that had enclosed his head in boyhood walls destined to be his own in the course of time to creep like a across these well known walks and into this familiar house to meet in this manner this of innocence when stepped into the room where miss was waiting his heart knocked so loudly against his ribs that he could almost hear it well i am here he said in a low voice to the most musical accents of which he was master upon conducting him to her mistress the maid had retreated into the closing but not the door behind her no sooner had she disappeared than overcome with joy stretched out his arms to my darling he cried in tones of the deepest passion will you now refuse me that kiss which i have waited for so long the young girl seemed quite composed making a marked contrast to his you must have forgotten what i told you replied gently he caught both her hands in his that you would only kiss the man who be your husband behold him she hesitated still regarding him intently aught in thb act do you swear that she asked do you swear that i shall be your wife only a minute before this the young man had been firm in his resolution not to say anything to commit himself the dependence that he had upon his uncle was so absolute that he had meant to be in his words however careless his conduct might appear but he was with the sweetness of the creature before him and to save his life he could not have made her a different reply with all my soul he answered earnestly waited no longer but permitted him to clasp her in his arms and press a kiss upon her lips have you thought how we are to arrange it she said as soon as she could escape from his caresses to arrange it her thoughts were not to be turned even for a moment from the subject of marriage that will be all right in time he responded after a slight pause for the present is it not wisest to take the happiness that comes to us and leave all difficult problems for the future such meetings as this ought to be devoted to the of love not passed in sober calculations how to escape the happiest period of life she looked slightly troubled and does the of love end with matrimony she asked in her way why no he replied confused for the moment but lovers usually like to as much as love at seventy that delightful time when they have become all in all to each other and yet are by legal ties in our case there are a hundred to marriage which must all be broken down to our love there was but one and that and her keys has easily opened showed the greatest interest in every word he said are there really so many to our marriage she asked tell me what they are well the two greatest perhaps are my uncle and your mother she brightened at this for she had feared that his answer would reveal some terrible obstacle of whose existence she had been unaware those are easily surmounted she smiled my mother would not stand in the way of anything i insisted upon and as for your uncle he has no legal control over my actions wished that she would not be so precise and positive he blushed as he felt that he could not explain his own situation without laying himself open to the charge of selfishness my uncle could refuse to do anything more for me in a pecuniary way which to say the least would be embarrassing the girl knit her brows and into thought you could earn a living could you not without his aid i supposed any man of education and talent could do that we shall not need much and i will gladly do all i can to help you she looked so as she uttered these caught in the act words that could not help embracing her again i wish with all my heart he replied and he had never spoken more earnestly that i had been brought up to do ,1,Arthur Conan Doyle

and another until there was rarely a day that we did not see each mt sympathy jl other and you must not judge of s conduct on the basis of the rules that prevail in larger there is in many of these quiet new england villages an almost simplicity still in the relations of the sexes perhaps no greater average virtue can be found in civilized lands and yet the young women do not think it necessary

some inscrutable reason i happened to pick up this one as i sat in the office of the house one morning after breakfast the first thing that met my wa the husband s friend announcement in the society column that the mar of professor and miss would take place at the house on the following wednesday the most harmless of you will say when you know that i was already aware of the date and that the item contained nothing whatever that was at all new to me but here is one of the peculiarities of the human mind though i knew that the marriage was to occur on the date and at the place mentioned i did not relish having the fact thrust in my face in this fashion it had the effect upon me of a challenge if not of an insult all that i might have felt and said when the professor came into the room and found his sweetheart s arms about my neck swept over me like a flood my mind began to be filled with ideas i thought of taking the first train to boston and doing i did not know what to stop the ceremony it seemed as if i could not live after she had given herself to that man whom i had every reason to know she would never love as she could have loved me i grew very indignant as i thought

think you would like i will let you know it seems so odd though to imagine you married there was something that he wanted to ask her and he did not know how to put it into the best form it s all right is it he inquired i mean marriage is a good thing you know there s been considerable in the papers about its being a failure she looked gravely at the earnest eyes i have found it heaven she responded with reverence there must be some grave fault where it is otherwise george was not so ignorant but that he knew of mrs drew s approaching as she uttered that statement with the in her eyes and the smile of perfect content on her lips she seemed more angel than human as he walked home he resolved that he would marry that he would know the experiences that could bring such happiness he entered his solitary home the walls of george and which had never seemed quite so silent they must echo to the sound of a new voice they must feel the glory of another presence within a few weeks a former friend of mrs drew s a young lady with whom she had spent a year at boarding school came to make her a visit as passed the window one evening on his way home called miss s attention to him there is a man in a thousand she said do you know any very nice girl who wants a husband i have promised to look up a wife for him miss had had her experience falling desperately in love two years before with a young man of the town where she resided who after the was set suddenly disappeared and never was heard of again for some time she took a violent dislike to all the male sex and was heard to declare that she would live and die an old maid no matter what offers she had but she was still young only twenty three and this story interested her before long miss obtained an introduction to mr her visit to lasted more than a month and when she returned home she wrote to drew that they were engaged you are not to mention it to anyone for the world she said it is to be kept a secret for the present i know you will be surprised and i feel a little that way myself i had determined to live single but perhaps i shall be happier in the married state you can talk to him about it but to no one else mind until i give you leave mrs drew to put it mildly was not pleased at this news she had not suspected what was going out of on and women do not fancy being in such matters george was so slow with the female sex that she could not understand how he had made such progress after knowing miss but weeks altogether was not the she would have picked out for him and yet had she been pressed for a reason she could not have told you why she felt at not being consulted before the fatal words were spoken but she was too good a woman to let these thoughts mar her congratulations and the first time she saw george she told him he had her warmest wishes for a happy future i suppose it seems rather sudden to you he said in a tone of apology but during the month i have grown so i can hardly live then i knew that i mean miss was a dear friend of yours and that was enough for her we are only to wait two months is that too soon she said september was a very good time of year mrs drew could see it all now miss had done most of the certainly george would never have made such rapid progress with a less interested girl well it might turn out all right there was no use in worrying over it but say all she could was not the wife would have chosen for this man she was a dear friend of yours sweet and pathetic reason how dearly she hoped he would never regret the step as for there was no question that the marriage was a good one for her there were few men like george it was in september the month she had selected george and that george brought his young wife to and took her to the home his mother had made sacred to him she was to take the place and more than the place of that parent mrs the second was naturally a quiet girl previous to her wedding the conversations between the lovers had been of extremely limited extent on his part everything had been taken for granted he thought in his simple that the duties of wives and husbands were fixed by law he had heard to be sure of cases that did not come up to the proper standard but he believed them confined to a lower class of society with which he had nothing to do he weighed the solemn words of the minister before whom their vows were taken and never dreamed that there could be of the least thing that was spoken and there were other things not alluded to established by custom so clearly that to repeat them would be the merest nonsense being willing to give to his wife all he was all he had all he could make himself he expected the same in return the concern for which worked the occasion of his marriage by adding five

my heart for that june aunt has now a theme exactly to her taste in the growing extravagance of george s wife mrs has certainly her style of dress a good deal a thing which is the more noticeable from the fact that in we are on the whole so little given to gorgeous i remember that when i called i thought her rather to day aunt talked for half an hour with the greatest apparent enjoyment about the fine gowns and expensive with which the bride is astonishing the town i am afraid it does not take much to set us talking i tried half a dozen times to day to change the subject but my efforts were wasted aunt was not to be diverted from a theme so congenial i reminded her that any bride was expected to display her finery â this is part of the established formality with which marriage is attended that s all very well she retorted with a folks want to see the wedding this is finery george has had to pay for himself i don t see how anybody can know that i told her and i added that it did not seem to me to be the town s business if it were true she tells everybody he gave her the aunt responded and the dresses she s had made since she was married she had n t anything herself the say she was real poor the marriage was so sudden i said that very likely she had n t time to get her wedding at the of a saint any rate aunt i don t see what you and i have to do with her clothes the dear old gossip went on her foot and smiling with evident delight it s the business of the neighbors that she s sure to ruin her husband if she keeps on with her extravagance isn t it besides she wears her clothes to have them talked about she talks about them herself a few dresses won t ruin her husband i protested she has one hired girl now and she s talking of a second aunt went on did you ever hear of such foolishness i reminded her that i had two maids myself oh you she returned that s different i hope you don t put her on a level with real folks do you i tried to treat the whole matter as if it were of no consequence and i did stop the talk here but secretly i am troubled george has very little aside from what he in his profession and he might easily run behind if his wife is really extravagant he needs a woman to help him save june delighted the family to day by her wonderful in following with her eyes the flight of a blue bottle fly that about the nursery such intelligence in one so young is held by us women to the most extraordinary promise i communicated the important event to mr who came to call and he could neither take it gravely nor laugh at the absurdity of our noticing so slight a thing he seemed to be trying to june find out how i wished him to look at it and as i was divided between laughter and secret pride in baby he could not get a sure clue how dull the man is but no doubt he is good when piety and stupidity are united it is unfortunate that they should be made prominent by being set high in spiritual places june i have a good deal of sympathy with s question when he asked the lord if he were his brother s keeper of course his crime turned the question in his case into a mere pitiful excuse but was at least clever enough to take advantage of a principle which must appeal to everybody we cannot be responsible for others when we have neither authority nor control over them it is one of the hardest forms of duty it seems to me when we feel that we ought to do our best yet are practically sure that in the end we can effect little or nothing what can i do to influence george s wife somehow we seem to have no common ground to meet on father used to say that people who do not speak the same language cannot communicate moral ideas to each other this is rather a high sounding way of saying that mrs and i cannot understand each other when anything of real importance comes up it is of course as much my fault as hers but i really do not know how to help or change it i suppose there is a certain and self in my feeling that i could direct her but i am certainly older and i believe i am wiser yet i am not her keeper and if to feel that i am not me in the cowardice of i cannot help it i am ready to do anything i can do but what is there the of a saint june still it is george s wife i dare say a good deal of talk has been and i have not heard it i have been so occupied with graver matters ever since george was married that i have seen few people and have paid little heed to the village talk to day old lady said her say she began by reminding me of the conversation we had had in regard to calling on the bride i am glad we did it she went on it puts us in the right whatever happens but she will not do i shall never ask her to my house i could say nothing i knew she was right but i was so sorry for george she is vulgar the sweet old voice went on she called a second time on me yesterday and ,3,Charles Dickens

these improvements were first introduced that many of fellow farmers sneered at them but he went on his own way paying no attention to their he was obliged to keep a large force of men and carried out these improvements in seasons when they had plenty of time on their hands he certainly had the satisfaction of the best kept farm in the state and one that produced more on the average per acre than any other and if this were not enough his comfortable bank account had long ago proved that there was something worth considering in methods that placed one in advance of those who him starting the

his daughter s happiness giving way to rose colored expectations as he noted the confidence of his companion they the steamer at took the usual short run through ireland crossed to scotland where they spent a fortnight and then by easy stages stopping at many places of interest came to world s metropolis a cry chapter a cry for help had not been twenty four hours in london before he began to realize that he was practically under he occupied the peculiar position of being in a foreign land with hardly a dollar in his pocket and with watchful eyes following his every movement it was no part

and wife all expected this and if it did not occur there would be a suspicion that had been was constantly at his elbow ready to meet any doubt and the colonel was more than willing to be convinced

her husband chapter vi mrs s story was much pleased with the courtesy of the link in permitting him to gain at first hand further details of this mysterious case with a natural curiosity by his short acquaintance with the unfortunate he was most anxious to learn why the man had secluded himself from the world in square who were the enemies he hinted at as desirous of his death and in what manner and for what reason he had met with so barbarous a fate at their hands it seemed likely that mrs who asserted herself to be the wife of the deceased would be able to answer these questions in full therefore he was punctual in keeping the appointment at the office of link he was rather astonished to find that mrs had arrived and was deep in conversation with the while a third person who had evidently accompanied her sat near at hand silent but attentive to what was being discussed as the dead man had been close on sixty years of age and mrs claimed to be his wife had quite ex the silent house to meet with an elderly woman instead of doing so however he beheld a pretty young lady of not more than twenty five whose of widow s weeds set off her beauty to the greatest advantage she was a charming with golden hair and blue eyes and a complexion of rose leaf hue in spite of her grief her was lively and engaging and her smile particularly attractive lighting up her whole face in the most fascinating manner her hands and feet were small her stature was that of a fairy and her figure was perfect in every way altogether mrs looked like a or a dainty of china and should have been arrayed in robes rather than in the deep mourning she affected indeed considered that such weeds were rather premature as mrs could not yet be certain that the murdered man was her husband but she looked so charming and a creature that he forgave her being too eager to consider herself a widow perhaps with such an elderly husband her eagerness was natural from this charming vision s eyes wandered to the attentive third person a rosy plump little man of between fifty and sixty from his resemblance to mrs â for he had the same blue eyes and pink and white complexion â guessed that he was her father and such indeed proved to be the case link on s entrance introduced him to the in black who the silent house in her turn presented him to the silvery haired benevolent old man whom she called mr at the first sound of their voices detected so pronounced a and so curious a way of words as to conclude that mrs and her amiable parent hailed from the states the little lady seemed to pride herself on this and indicated her republican origin in her speech more than was necessary â at least thought so but then on occasions he was disposed to be say now said mrs casting an glance on s face i m right down glad to see you mr link here was just saying you knew my husband mr i knew him as mr â mark replied taking a seat just think of that now cried mrs with a rather subdued in compliment to her apparel and his real name was mark well i guess he won t need no name now poor man and the widow touched her bright eyes carefully with a doll s pocket handkerchief which noted somewhat was perfectly dry maybe he s an angel by this time said mr in a cheerful voice so it ain t no use wishing him back as i can see we ve all got to kingdom come some time or another not in the same way i hope said the silent house but i beg your pardon link i interrupt your conversation by no means replied the readily we had begun when you entered mr and it wasn t much of a talk anyhow said mrs i was only replying to some stupid questions stupid if you will but necessary observed link with gravity let us continue are you certain that this dead man or rather was â your husband fm as sure as sure can be sir is the name of our place near bath and it looks as though my husband called himself after it when he changed his colours and isn t his first name mark pursued the pretty widow well my husband was called mark too so there you are â mark is this all your proof asked link calmly i guess not though it s enough i should say my husband had a mark on his right cheek â got it fighting a with a german student when he was having a high time as one of the boys at then he lost part of his little finger â finger â in an accident out west what other proof do you want mr link the proofs you have given seem sufficient mrs but may i ask when your husband left his home about a year ago eh the silent house you arc it corrected die father size it up as ten months and you ll do ten months said suddenly and mr struck in the widow mark i beg your pardon well mark took the e in square six months back where was he during the other four ask me something easier mr i know no more than you do did you not know where he went on leaving how should i mark and i didn t pull together so he kicked over the traces and made tracks for the back of beyond and you might square it by saying as t you who upset the apple cart well i should smile to think so said mrs vigorously ,12,Mark Twain

after serving part of his term had been largely on account of the efforts of the somebody he had shot the somebody must be louis yes i was obliged to admit that it looked like a clear case but why is going to africa i inquired that is the question at present yes said that is the question before i leave there with net i will have something more definite than a theory too she spoke about a priest and about a mayor i remarked and what does that signify asked i acknowledged that i did not know both of those had a considerable place in the out op arrangement of most lives and were to be found in as well as elsewhere but what connection they had with miss i could not guess the best thing for me i added with a smile in relation to this story is to wait as we do for other until it comes out speculations are rather useless you wouldn t like to join the party and go to with us would you asked i would said i but for one thing i was there some time ago and the country quite thoroughly i have planned to spend next winter in the west indies you are very kind to suggest my going however and i am infinitely obliged it isn t altogether kindness that me said with the manner of one who makes a confession i want to find out the mystery in this affair and i fear i shall never do it alone i responded that i believed he would and added that nothing would give me greater pleasure than to meet him when he had done so it would be worth putting into a book wouldn t it he asked decidedly i answered with enthusiasm the next day i parted from mr as paths lay in opposite directions it was nearly a year before we met again and then it was on american soil at the house in x h meeting i can finish that story now he exclaimed with a beaming smile as he pressed my hand with the of our renewed meeting finish it then i said and he finished it miss s chapter xxv meeting it was about the middle of october said when we had taken seats in an open carriage and were being driven toward the that miss master and myself with a couple of maids and a started for africa before we began the journey i had a long talk with in which i endeavored to persuade her to give me at least an of the purpose she had in view but without effect even a hint that i should decline to accompany her after all did not her from her attitude go with me she pleaded and as soon as i can possibly do so i will tell you all about it at present i really cannot upon reaching we went to the hotel de where we were pleasantly greeted by the proprietor by victor and the other members of the om of establishment who remembered us i soon discovered that something of a secret nature was going on to which the new was a party and my pride was slightly wounded by the reflection that miss was willing to trust this fellow with matters which she did not wish me to know they had frequent that lasted for hours would go away for one or two days at a time and on his return find his mistress ready to see him no matter what other engagement she might at the moment have on hand i had occasion once or twice myself to make way for him and i have no hesitation in saying that i did not particularly like it nearly a month was passed in this manner and i began to find even beautiful very dull i believe heaven itself would grow wearisome if i had to wait within its golden streets for something to happen of whose nature and date i had no reasonable conception i wandered about the streets through the native quarter over the hill and into the all of which i had thoroughly on my previous visit until i grew as tired of it as i could well be then when things were becoming almost i met a very interesting stranger it was in the office of cook son that gigantic institution which one finds in every corner of the globe it

disappointed to find that there was no regular excursion carriage to the place and remarked casually that he did not like the idea of going alone i thought you might be getting up a party he explained it is tiresome taking that kind of a journey all by his words expressed so well the thought that had been in my own mind that i looked at him with interest the next minute i decided to take advantage

in the city of paris they had traversed the place de la con with its its fountains and its memories of a great past and after creeping at that s pace which is the delight of the along the magnificent way they paused at the arch of triumph which stands the wonder of nations in the place de paris always lovely from april to october is at its best in june and this particular afternoon was as nearly perfect as one could desire the gentlemen were both young if being on the sunny side of thirty a man to that distinction each was in fact nine and twenty years of age and they had known each other ever since their boyhood days when they attended the same in one of the american cities though the husband friend attached of friends they were little alike either in their views of life their habits of thought or their manner of address was the name of the of the pair a bright sunny faced fellow with a good color a pair of blue eyes and an build he seemed to his own spirits into everything and entertained his companion with a constant fire of running small talk in reference to the sights of their drive the other was of mould with more of the aspect of the student in his make up and it would not have taken a very close observer to have detected in his appearance on this june morning a that seemed almost unnatural as soon as the carriage in which the friends rode paused before the arch of triumph burst into enthusiastic of it both as a work of art and for the genius which it is meant to to all of the praises which he his companion returned however only replies for a time was too much taken up with the of his own to note his friend s mood but at length it dawned upon him that his interest in the monument was not being wholly shared and he paused in the midst of an unusually glowing period to ascertain the reason it occurs to me my dear he said with a smile that you are not paying as strict attention to my as a good should give to his guide are you fully of tht fact that you are standing before the arch that the world now possesses if not as i believe the it ever has owned do df the place l know that this spot on which you are with its twelve great avenues from this star is the centre of all that is beautiful in france and the envy of every other capital in the other gentleman acknowledged the question by a slight bow but gave no indication of being particularly impressed by the points you must not forget harry he replied pleasantly that this is not the first time i have seen this arch i rode past here on sunday on my way to the i am quite sure for all that responded his friend that this does not explain your coolness people usually find the monument growing upon them with each visit i know it has been so with me the same as it was with the church of st peter at rome if i were to come here every day for a year i think it would impress me more and more to the end you have seen it twice and your interest in it is exhausted you have not a word to say in its praise there is no astonishment in your gaze no lighting up of your countenance in the presence of the perfect work grew slightly uneasy at the knowledge that he was being forced to make an answer he did not relish i will take no issue with you he said on its beauties but oh confound it don t bring your notions into such a discussion as this y cried harry with an expression of the greatest aversion try to understand what this arch truly represents it the vi y tones of the greatest soldier who ever the her s earth a nation does well to remember its noblest sons and france has done no wiser thing than to rear this arch to napoleon and to build that house for his ashes whose dome you can see over there at the the cab driver happy in knowing that he was to be paid by the hour sat on his box in the sun and wondering what the two were talking about so earnestly a slight gesture of impatience you know very well harry that i consider that sort of thing stuff and nonsense said he was simply and solely an ambitious soldier of fortune who coldly sacrificed a million mistaken followers to gain for himself an empire the greatest in the world and perished miserably in a prison as he deserved all talk about his grandeur is lost on me as for this monument if one could consider it solely by itself it is indeed a thing of beauty if i were able to forget what it means i might become as enthusiastic as you are but when i look at it with the light of history in my eyes i can see only the of an butcher let us drive on the memories that this arch calls up will be likely to put me in an ill temper and the sooner we get away from it the better harry met these rather expressions with a musical laugh and bidding the coachman continue the drive into the he entered the carriage with his friend as they passed down the avenue de la e he resumed the conversation at the point where it had been left off as you are of along line of french rulers if not of princes through your ancestors

existence for them would make all the work already done on this manuscript mere wasted time turned from his friend in disgust could the man talk nothing think nothing but shop but did not come to the wedding he knew the final strain would be more than he could bear it was one thing to sacrifice the woman he jl black loved and quite another to see her given into the arms of the rival he had encouraged one may do the noblest things at a respectful distance and find himself physically unable to view them at greater of course was almost too happy to breathe but even the happiest of lovers somehow manage to a of to keep life in them though they have no knowledge of the process by which this is accomplished he had seen several of his productions in type some in the leading magazines and he had a permanent position now on the staff of a great when the month he had allowed himself as necessary for a wedding journey was ended he would settle down to work and he knew no reason why he might not make a success in his chosen field and there was always he would never again be separated from who that has loved and been loved can doubt the perfect content of this young man the face at was that of mr who failed in his best attempts to appear cheerful he was not sorry that his daughter was to be married he would not have put a single obstacle in her way but she was going from him and the very very dear relations they had so long sustained would never be exactly the same again it was the destiny of a woman to to her husband he found no fault with the law of nature but he had clung to so that he could not welcome very sincerely the hour that was to take her away was the marriage was to be early in the evening everything was ready even to the trunks filled with and other dresses the night was to be passed at the imperial hotel in the city and the journey proper to be begun some time on the following day on the most momentous morning of her life announced that she had an errand to do in the city and would return shortly after o clock as she was so thoroughly her own mistress nobody thought of questioning her more particularly but twelve o clock came and one o clock and three and five and she neither was seen at nor was any message received from her by the latter hour mr was in a state of excitement the entire house was in an uproar the servants were one by one to see if perchance any of them could guess the young lady s destination word was sent by to various places in the city asking information but none was received she had left the house to go to new york and nothing could be learned of her from that moment as mr was not expected until some time later mr went at last to the city and sought the young man at his rooms he found him in the company of dressed for the ceremony and impatient for the arrival of the hour when he should start for his bride s abode it may be conceived that the news mr brought was not the for him you you have not seen came the stain a black question as the father paused on the threshold of s room to day why certainly not was the answer i was just about to start for your house mr sank upon a sofa just inside the door something has happened he groaned ah my boy something has happened to my child looked at mr who in turn looked at mr she went away morning on an errand the father slowly saying she would return at noon and that is the last we have seen of her oh it seems as if i should go mad it seemed as if would go mad too he looked like one of sense as he stood there without uttering a word perhaps she has returned since you left home suggested mr on the spur of the instant don t lose heart yet let me send to a office and have them inquire you have a in your house have you not mr the father bowed in reply he was too crushed to say anything unnecessary touching a button mr soon had a messenger for the information desired and in the meantime he tried by suggesting possibilities to soothe the two men you shouldn t get so he protested there are a hundred slight accidents that might be responsible for miss s delay perhaps she has met with an insignificant accident and the word where was si i she has sent to her father has gone astray as happens ,1,Arthur Conan Doyle

at four that afternoon everything worked to a charm mr ar t the time and went promptly to like a stock pig mr s apartments a brief explanation of what was about to occur threw the wool merchant into a state of extreme agitation but he was assured that the last of danger to himself would be removed before he left the house he was asked to step into an inner room of the the door of which was to be left and to make no move unless he was called mr came at his appointed hour and soon after delighted to find both gentlemen accidentally as he supposed the negro began without delay to explain the cause of his visit he stated the manner in which he had discovered the and said he thought it only his duty to let the facts be known messrs and exchanged glances of surprise as the proceeded how long is it since you first knew of this matter asked mr when came to a pause something like eighteen months and you allowed this to go on all that time without saying a word said the i am surprised when i remember that for a long time you saw me almost daily that is true was the quiet response i could not easily bring myself to disgrace one whose bread i was eating but that does not matter now i have here a number of notes on which mr has both of your names the law will hold him just as strongly as if i had exposed him at the time he exhibited a of papers and a black passed them to the two gentlemen the band spread the documents on the centre table and went over them carefully with mr separating those which bore their several names a close perusal of all the notes followed and finally mr looked up and asked if there were any more no those are all said i believe there are thirty six of them mr consulted in a low tone with mr they seemed puzzled over something if these are really all the notes you have said there has been a great mistake on your part these are genuine in every case where are the papers of which you spoke the negro stared with all his might at the speaker genuine he repeated undoubtedly as far as my name is concerned i have lent my credit to mr for a long time that is equally true of myself spoke up slowly i wrote every one of these and i am willing to swear to them s eyes flashed with baffled rage he had been these men had to save his late employer from his they had lied deliberately and he was powerless against their combined although he knew the of all they said you will be as glad as we to learn the truth said in a softly voice it would have grieved you to know that your kind employer like a stuck pig had made himself to the criminal law your only object in this matter was to ease your conscience and do justice there is nothing now to prevent your returning at your earliest convenience to france the negro rose and took up his hat this is nice he growled but i want to tell you that you are not through with me yet mr rose also i trust he said that you are not going to be i certainly would not be guilty of to you but let me assure you of one thing if you ever hereafter annoy in the slightest degree my friend mr or any member of his family you will wish heartily that you had never been born we can spare you now mr with the last words waved his hand toward the door and without further reply than a glare from his now blood shot eyes the african strode from the apartment i want you to take a ride in the park with me for an hour or go and then we will return here for dinner said mr to mr he did this to allow mr to leave the house without knowing he was there and also to avoid a meeting that he felt would be too full of gratitude to suit his temperament just then a black aim chapter xxi want to understand had been so busy on her second novel that she had hardly noticed the prolonged absence of from her father s house her first

woven it would make a success far greater than the other thought she understood the young man perfectly to her mind he was merely awaiting the moment when she was ready to name the day for their marriage to be sure he had not asked her to wed him but his actions were not to be misunderstood she would accept him for business reasons and the romance could come later together they would constitute a strong in fiction while she was wrapped up in her writing it was quite as well that he remained at a respectful distance between her second and her third story she would have time to

him playing ball seemed a foolish form of amusement they appreciate at once that he is speaking from a point of view which ia not theirs and which they have no wish to share he must be able to make it evident that the book in question with attractions which he must frankly acknowledge ia poor when judged by standards which the pupils feel to be true and which belong to the sphere of boyhood i confess with that in my zeal for good literature i have in earlier days spoken contemptuously of popular and books which i had reason to think my boys probably enjoyed and admired i believe i was wrong now i do not hesitate to say what i think about any book when a student me but i make it a rule never in to attack specific books or authors for anything but and that question is hardly likely to arise in the secondary schools i cannot afford to run the risk of the sympathies of my pupils and of a feeling that my point of view is far removed from theirs that they can talks on literature not trust my opinions to be the normal attitude of the child toward the is likely enough to be that of believing grown to ba so far from what children really care for as to be entirely in the selection of reading the child or the judgments of his not on abstract grounds but merely from an feeling that do not look at from his i of view always fear lest by an unwise condemnation of a book a lad enjoyed i may be this perfectly natural and inevitably conviction the first and moat important means of outside reading is by upon the child s mind the idea that he is studying literature chiefly for the sake of reading to himself and for himself about this should be no doubt or uncertainty no child should for a moment be allowed to suppose that such dealing with books as is possible in the school room can be chiefly for its own sake can be so much an and as a means to allow him to suppose that the few works he goes over can be held to represent the great literary treasures of the race or that he can be supposed to do more to learn how to deal with literature for himself is at once to make instruction in this branch more an injury than a benefit it would be no more reasonable than to allow him to think that he the for the sake of his school sums rather than voluntary that he may have an effective tool to help him in the practical affairs of life to influence outside work of any sort is difficult especially in city schools where the pupils are subject to so many the teacher is generally obliged to make his effort in this direction almost entirely individual treating no two exactly in the same way and he is not obliged to employ a considerable amount of in the process when i wish to talk to john smith about his reading a clever teacher said in my hearing i send to him to see me about his or his handwriting or anything to give an excuse for a chat then i bring in the thing i am at as if by accident the number of possessed of the the time and the patience for this sort of is probably not large but much may be done by words dropped apparently by chance if only the has the matter earnestly at heart how far the relation of books in the required reading to books read voluntarily may be insisted upon in class must depend largely upon the particular pupils involved every teacher will certainly do well to find out what his students are reading outside if they are reading anything and he should then consider what to make of his knowledge the very fact that he concerns himself about the matter will call the attention of the class to the fact that a connection exists and that it is real enough to be worth any wise j talks on teaching literature teacher will i l an advantage in indications of the natural tastes and inclinations of those ho is trying to train and to know what the boys and girls really like to read will often correct a tendency to speak of the required in a tone that is outside tlie range of the of the scholars if he knows that the girls are fond of weeping over the broken heart of the that the boys in the bloody that both find mrs pigs of the exquisitely amusing he sees at once that he must be cautious in dwelling on the pathos of the romance of the flight of a tribe or the of charles lamb children fed on intellectual so coarse would find real and must be trained with frank acceptance of that fact to say that teachers may also often do something in the way of parents to do their p i in guiding the reading of children is to go somewhat outside of my field the public asks so much of teachers already that any hint of labor in the homes of pupils â and in many cases would be â nothing less than the suggestion of an impossibility if i were to urge the matter i should do it purely on the ground that teachers may sometimes greatly lessen the difficulty of the task they undertake in the school room by a little judicious labor in the home in the public schools to day many children perhaps even a majority come from homes wherein no literary standard is voluntary reading apparent and where for the most part none exists they are being given a training which their parents did not have and they feel themselves better able to direct ,3,Charles Dickens

you who devote yourself to dining out and who are to be daily seen sitting down to such as i know mainly by â by the report of guests and others who were present â you cannot escape the little things that spoil the picture and which the fancy does not see for instance in handing you la at the very commencement of this dinner to day john the waiter who never did such a thing before did this time suffer the plate to tip so that a little of that rare soup into your lap â just enough to spoil those trousers which is nothing to you because you can buy a great many more trousers but which little event is with the fine with the fragrant the glittering glass the beautiful guests and the mood of mind suggested by all of these there is in fact if you will pardon a free use of the there is a upon your remembrance of this dinner or in the same way and with the same kind of mental result you can easily imagine the a little tough a suspicion of smoke somewhere in the too much perhaps or too little salt or there might be the graver of not properly or a choice below the average mark or the of some of that marvellous for its innumerable of the globe and for being as dry as the conversation of the host these things are not up to the high level of the dinner for wherever all should be as perfect in their kind as she the principal is in hers that reminds me of a possible worse than all suppose that soup had down the of s dress since it might have done so instead of wasting itself upon your trousers could even the elegance of your manners have contemplate ed unmoved a spot upon your remembrance of the you smile of course and remind me that that lady s manners are so perfect that if she drank poison she would wipe her mouth after it as gracefully as ever how much more then you say in the case of such a slight as her dress would she appear totally unmoved so she would undoubtedly she would be and look as pure as ever but my young friend her dress would not once i dropped a in the lap of my who wore on the occasion her silk gown i did not love my the less but there certainly was a very spot upon her dress and although i know my to be yet whenever i recall that day i see her in a spotted gown and i would prefer never to have been obliged to think of her in such a garment can you not make the application to the case very to happen of some of that toilet of s in j ing down stairs for instance why should not heavy old mr who is coming dose behind with mrs both very eager for dinner tread upon the hem of that garment j which my lips would grow pale to kiss the august yielding to natural laws would be drawn suddenly backward â a very movement â and the dress would be there would be apologies and smiles and forgiveness and up the pieces nor would there be the faintest feeling of awkwardness or vexation in s mind but to you looking on and all that pure show of waistcoat cursing old s carelessness this tearing of dresses and repair of the toilet is by no means a poetic and cheerful spectacle nay the very impatience that it produces in your mind upon the harmony of the moment you will respond with proper scorn that you are not so fastidious as to heed the little necessary of social meetings and that you have not much regard for the harmony of the occasion which phrase i fear you will repeat in a tone you will do very right in saying this and it is a remark to which i shall give all the hospitality of my mind and i do so because i heartily in it i hold a man to be very foolish who will not eat a good dinner because the table cloth is not clean or who at the spots upon the sun but still a man who does not apply his eye to a or some kind of prepared medium does not see those spots while he has just as much light and heat as he who does so it is with me i walk in the avenue and eat all the delightful dinners without seeing the spots upon the table cloth and behold all the beautiful without swearing at old i am the guest who for the small price of drinks only the best and talks only to the most agreeable people that is something i can tell you for you might be asked to take out old mrs my fancy slips in between you and sit you never so closely together it not only hears what she says but it what she a thinks and feels it lies like a bee in her thoughts all their honey if there are or guests at table it will not see them it knows only the good and fair as i stroll in the fading light and observe the stately houses my fancy believes the host equal to his house and the courtesy of his wife more agreeable than her it will not believe that the pictures on the wall and the statues in the comers shame the guests it will not allow that they are less than noble it hears them speak gently of error and warmly of worth it knows that they commend heroism and devotion and my fancy is convinced that the guests are not only upon the fruits of every land and season but are refreshed by a consciousness of greater loveliness ,16,Rudyard Kipling
t the least idea that you could leave the room and the impression with them is that train is you shrugged his shoulders with contempt and passed george another cigar just as though the man would himself if that were so george did not his cigar well as you have told me so much mr i may as well confess if i am to help you i must know all then you shall whatever i can tell you hesitated and guessed that he was not going to be so frank as was necessary however he made no remark and continued i came to this house to see mrs and get the truth out of her it was my intention to speak to her the next morning however in the she stated that she wished the company to at ten o clock as she had business to attend to also she came up to this room to see if i and my friend were in bed at eleven i guessed that she intended to see some one and wondering if the expected person had anything to do with my business i determined to see her on that night when train was asleep i locked my bedroom door and made use of the cupboard how did you know of its existence i lived here as you know this is a queer old house full of these sort of things i expect that door was made by some so that he might be able to lead a double life nodded i know fair to the world and black to the heart mr at home as a boy i discovered the cupboard replied not taking notice of this interruption and i am ashamed to say that i sometimes made use of it in my to go to the to my grandfather on that night i used it again and went to the sitting room of mrs it was about twelve o clock the door of the room was closed i opened it and saw her sitting at the table dead as she was discovered in the morning in stooping over her to see if she still breathed the must have fallen it says a great deal for train s that he suspected me on such evidence i now see why he was so different to me when we parted and why he has been so stiff of late what did you do after you found that the woman was dead i returned to my bedroom and said nothing about it you see since i wanted something from mrs and that desire might have come out in the evidence there was every chance that i would be accused of having murdered her there was certainly motive enough i don t agree with you replied however i quite understand that under the circumstances you lost your nerve you returned to your room and expressed suitable surprise the next nodded quite so and then train s having locked this door made me think that all was safe had he not told oh he has told very little rejoined after all nothing can be done if i hold my tongue nothing will be done in any case said george grimly but i thank you for warning me mr what are you plans i have none at present lord asked me to watch you the yellow that you certainly have done and if you choose you can go on watching me but why do you stop in this house oh i knew mrs some years ago and returned here for old times sake shrugged his shoulders he felt convinced that was not speaking openly but then on his part had held something back neither man was sufficiently sure of the other to be perfectly frank but the main thing was that being friendly was content to let matters stand as they were that is so far as regarded george himself for felt that the s presence in that house had something to do with the murder he rose to go well how do we stand asked much as we did before replied george save that i know you will hold your tongue and not get me into trouble i shall certainly do that but remember mrs ward lord can stop her mouth ah but will he asked i shall call on lord and see answered and with a nod left the room he s a plucked un said chapter a fireside tyrant lord should have been born emperor of ancient rome or of modern russia he would have made an admirable as he was fairly good when all about him were on their knees serving him even then his temper was none of the best those who held their own he hated while the many who gave in to his will received contempt as their reward even at seventy five the old man s temper had not cooled and the majority of people avoided him as they would the plague originally he had started life with a sufficiently imperious will and thanks to his position as a and wealthy orphan he had been enabled to exercise it at a very early age the habit of seeing every one terrified of his mere glance grew upon him and he became not only to live with but even to meet his wife after presenting him with two sons had died gladly seeing no other way of escaping her tyrant and the report went that he had her out of existence would have married again for the sake of his boys but like henry whom he greatly resembled he could find no one willing to endure his yoke consequently he became something of a woman and entered the political world in this he met with a certain amount of opposition which did him good and might have been trained into a de the yellow cent member of society but that his was ,12,Mark Twain

capable of doing so knew this well enough and reflected for a few moments say nothing to or to anyone he remarked finally until you find the will and we can look over it together oh i shall certainly hold my tongue said the quickly believe me it is only my esteem for you which makes me urge you not to notice the will sleep on the question for the morning is wiser than the night this matter will remain strictly between ourselves now good night good night shook hands not to the s abrupt departure and when alone groaned over the unexpected fulfilment of his chapter vi counsel s opinion when having a weight on his mind woke shortly after dawn he remembered the s proverb and thought that it might be true morning certainly was wiser than the night with him as he began to ask himself why he should be so much disturbed over an matter certainly asserted positively that he had found a hundred year old will made in favor of the elder branch of the family and undoubtedly he spoke in a way which appeared to be genuine but then the was a queer eccentric person who sometimes believed his visions to be facts and who had on occasions some difficulty in between the real and the unreal in a perfectly honest way he might be making a mistake and turning over the matter before rising hoped fervently that such might prove to be the case on the other hand unless mr s statement had some foundation in fact it seemed improbable that he would think of such a thing there had never been any question as to the of holding the property and after a whole century had elapsed it seemed strange that such an odd question should be raised assuredly the must have found something which had to do with the i counsel s opinion x of the estates by the elder branch else the fantastic idea would not have entered his rather wavering mind but the will might not be good in law it might have been signed and not witnessed or there might be some flaw in its drawing up which would its provisions if this was the case was far too sensible to think of his lands and income to a man who on the face of it would make a bad use of the same on the other hand if the will was quite in order the squire was honest enough to step down from his throne and allow the king to take his seat evil as might prove to be his rule the whole question of right or wrong turned on the production of the will having reached this point in his meditations arose and cleared his brain by a cold bath it would be foolish to say that he was not worried for he felt very much upset as was natural seeing there was a chance of his being reduced to the condition of a was not rich but he had enough to live on so the acquisition of more money would only result in his greater extravagance in the purchase of jewels but if the will proved to be legal foresaw that he â the squire of â would be turned out of his pleasant home without a single penny and without any means of earning one he had no profession he had no trade he was not and â he was sure of this â would not allow him anything out of the estate this was uncomfortable enough in itself for a young man who liked the good things of this life but there was worse to follow he would lose since her father would undoubtedly prevent the marriage with a the girl herself as had said to the the lost would remain true but how could he ask her to become his wife when he could not support himself much less a it was all very painful and very disagreeable and descended to breakfast with a bad appetite you don t look at all well mr remarked mrs when she came for orders after breakfast perhaps you are sickening for a fever not at all replied her master more than he was accustomed to speak to this dismal woman i have had a night that s all ah well sir it s natural considering you are going to take such a serious step as marriage without thinking about it allowed mrs a certain amount of latitude but here she the mark he passed over her observation in silence and gave his orders for the day i shall have dinner at eight he remarked having arranged matters as i am going to town and will not be back until late going to see the lawyers i suppose sir mentioned the housekeeper with an odd look on her dreary face looked up suddenly wondering why she had made such a observation for it was in his mind to do what she had suggested why do you suppose that mrs well sir it s only natural as no doubt there are marriage to be prepared and all must be in order for the ceremony mrs said this enough and her reason appeared to be very plausible nevertheless her glance was so significant that wondered if she had guessed his trouble it seemed to be incredible counsel s opinion since had promised to hold his tongue until the matter was properly out yet there was a certain malicious triumph lurking in the housekeeper s look which hinted that she was rejoicing at his approaching after swift reflection thought that he was mistaken and was in the position of a man who sees a bird in every bush he therefore ignored mrs s remark and merely repeated that he would return late to dine the woman hesitated for a moment as if she wished to speak more plainly then

i saw that hia features were strongly hebrew and there was an air of the dignity fearfully in his mien and expression it was more than the dignity of an individual i could have believed that the pride of a race was in his person his eye presently fastened itself upon me as a stranger he came nearer and nearer to me as he paced rapidly to and fro and was evidently several times on the point of addressing me but looking over his shoulder he passed on at length with a great he paused for an instant and invited me to join him in his walk before the invitation was fairly uttered he was in motion again i followed but i could not overtake mm he kept just before me and turned occasionally with an air of terror as if he fancied i were him then glided on more rapidly his face was by no means agreeable but it had an inexplicable fascination as if it had been turned upon what no other mortal eyes had ever seen yet i could hardly tell whether it were probably an object of supreme beauty or of terror he looked at everything as if he hoped its impression might some and awful one and i was gradually possessed with the unpleasant idea that hia eyes were never closed â that in fact he never slept bv and i suddenly fixing me with his unnatural glare he whispered something which i could not understand and then darted forward even more rapidly as if he dreaded that in merely speaking he had lost time still the ship drove on and i walked hurriedly along the deck just behind my companion but our speed and that of the ship contrasted strangely with the smell of old and the and lazy groups smoking and leaning on the the seasons in endless succession and passed over the ship the twilight was summer haze at the stern while it was the winter mist at the bows but as a tropical breath like the warmth of a day suddenly touched the brow of my companion he sighed and i could not help saying you must be tired he only shook his head and quickened his pace but now that i had once spoken it was not so difficult to speak and i asked him why he did not stop and rest he turned for moment and a mournful sweetness shone in his dark eyes and haggard face it played around that strange look of ruined human dignity like a wan beam of late sunset about a crumbling and forgotten temple he bv a ih the put his hand hurriedly to his forehead as if he were trying to remember â like a lunatic who having heard only the of in his delirium suddenly in a conscious moment the familiar voice of love but who could this be to whom mere human sympathy was so sweet still moving he whispered with a sadness i want to stop but i cannot if i could only stop long enough to leap over the then he sighed long and deeply and added but i should not drown so much had my interest been excited by his face and movement that i had not observed the costume of this strange being he wore a black hat upon his head it was not only black but it was shiny even in the midst of this wonderful scene i could observe that it had the artificial of a second hand hat and at the same moment i was disgusted by the of old clothes â very old clothes indeed the mist and my sympathy had prevented my seeing before what a singular garb the figure wore it was all second hand and carefully but the garments were obviously collected from every part of the civilized globe good heavens as i looked at the coat i had a strange sensation i was sure that i had bv and i once worn that coat it was my wedding â long in the skirts â which had told me years and years before she had given away to the jew beggar she had ever seen the figure in my fancy â the features lost their antique grandeur and the restless eye ceased to be sublime from immortal and became only lively with mean cunning the apparition was fearfully grotesque but the driving ship and the mysterious company gradually restored its tragic interest i stopped and leaned against the side and heard the rippling water that i could not see and flitting through the mist with anxious speed the figure held its way what was he flying what conscience with sting pricked this victim on he came again nearer and nearer to me in his walk i with

wisdom let him name his name and tell them plainly he is snug the boxes t was a sage of the sex who after many years of experience remarked that men are queer that they are so in a positive sense no shrewd observer of mankind would deny but that they are so comparatively or absolutely would be a very hardy assertion if the queen of the household is of opinion that her associate majesty is very queer because he a height of the in the drawing room he holds probably a similar view of her fondness in the for what he describes as burnt beef a hopeless bachelor who himself upon what he called his freedom used to say with an air of and extreme caution that he supposed his married friends were probably what they called happy but he added that he never knew any of the happy pairs to agree upon the proper warmth of a room or the true turn of a roast or the just amount of fresh air still he said i do not assert that their matrimonial felicity was not great but the of the sage of the better sex that men are queer has been strongly confirmed by a recent decision of the authorities of the opera house in new york that important body producing the figures has announced in effect that as it is clear from the accounts that the of german opera is more profitable than that of italian and french opera combined it is evident that the public desires to hear italian and french opera and therefore for the present the german opera will be this is certainly delightful proof that men are queer and that one respected group of them by a signal display of are anxious to contribute to the of nations it is a striking illustration of the superiority of man to money and in the mad struggle for a mere material advantage this devotion to pure art the expense is a noble tribute to the of human nature another view has been advanced which is also interesting to the student of mankind it is put in this way that if the cost of the italian and french opera should be a hundred thousand dollars in a season more than that of the german yet it will be gladly paid by those of boxes who have an desire to proceed with their intellectual cultivation by audible conversation during the performance the argument is that these of the intellect hold that nothing is lost by not hearing the italian and french music and that the evening can be much more devoted to the conversation which takes place in an opera box still another view is even more honorable to the boxes while it does not the performance this view holds that the situation offers a choice of delights an embarrassment of riches charming and as the music may be yet still more lofty and f ing is the conversation and the boxes are therefore compelled to an alternative and very naturally and properly choose their own talk to the music the decision of the authorities may be consequently held to be designed to secure a of conversation in the boxes upon the lowest terms of loss this cannot but be regarded by a judicious public as a wise conclusion it is of course desirable that the wit and wisdom of the box chat should continue but at the least sacrifice and the least sacrifice seems to be considered the italian and french opera together with a certain sum of money upon these lowest terms every friend of humanity will be glad to know that the delights of the boxes will be it is even hinted also that there will be no disposition in an to hiss the interruption of italian and french opera if the boxes think fit upon intellectual grounds to accompany the dying falls of french and italian strains with a cheerful murmur of talk the will without a sense of loss if deed upon such occasions there should be any remaining the noble sacrifice of those public the boxes is still more strikingly illustrated by the fact that the italian opera in other countries as with us and that not only in england which has been the el of the artists of the southern school but in italy itself the opera of italy has declined the truth probably is that for some time in all cultivated countries italian opera which was a fashion was largely maintained as a social opportunity under conditions which most favored personal display and made the least intellectual demand it supplied also to the society in the boxes at the san the the the and her majesty s the entertainment in the persons of famous ma of an extraordinary performance the charm of that performance was the rippling and glittering of the sweet and tender melody of the sparkle of the romantic pathos of the brilliant strain of â none who have felt the spell will deny the enchantment but one age with its spirit and taste another a deeper stronger more earnest taste in music a higher general cultivation another theory of opera have come into the house and

you and to this sinful earth he went on during all my childhood during the early days of my manhood if indeed i have ever been worthy to be called a man i loved you both with such intensity that i could discover no difference between you i could not bear to contemplate the day when i should have to give either of you up out of that long struggle i emerged with my eyes partly opened i found that it was forgive me that it was she smiled for him to proceed saying only i know it it was that i could not live without he continued finishing the sentence why then did i not say so openly and honestly because my s the father s affairs the aid he had received from the colonel were known to me then mr did all in his power to keep and me apart i had my illness and you came to nurse me s mother s death took her away and letters which i wrote her were never answered i have since learned that she did not receive them and they were doubtless discouraged i came to england with you to see if i could regain my strength the way my father aided me in that is shown in an analysis that i have recently had made of the contents of this he took out the as he spoke and held it up before her astonished eyes this was the medicine he gave me three times a day the says it is of calculated to the judgment and to make him who takes it subject to easy influence while i supposed it was intended to build up my system it was really making of me a more creature than nature designed which god knows was unnecessary i knew as well as i knew i breathed that i had no right to marry you while my love was still s but i was in no condition to resist the strong mind that had determined to bend me to its will he had told me long ago that he would rather see me in my grave than the husband of the girl whose father he hated i am not trying to find an excuse for what i have done but only to let you see that there is after all a slight she leaned toward him with unmistakable sympathy i am very sorry for what you have suffered she an angel from heaven said sweetly you told me there was something more i am quite prepared he hesitated but was reassured by her manner don t despise me any more than you can help said he i had no right to marry you for another reason i i was married already she repeated the word already and looked dazed yes he handed her s and she grew radiant are you certain that your father will consent to let everything drop quietly he asked certain i can swear it then i am saved they talked together for the next half hour and his gratitude increased how can i ever thank you for your goodness he cried i do not wish thanks something makes me feel as if it were i who ought to thank you how can that be i have learned that i did not love you as i thought i did i liked you so well as the friend of my childhood and youth that i the sentiment for that of love had we lived together as husband and wife a few months i fear the knowledge would have come to me when it was too late to our steps told me once many years ago that she thought i would make a very nice old maid i have come to the conclusion that she was right she had arisen and he took her by the hand in an of delight if i can feel in the midst of my own happiness the he said that it has not been purchased at the cost of yours there will be nothing left for me to desire you may feel it said for i am convinced that it is true now before i go can you not send for that i may assure her also how much i desire that you both should be happy he went to a table and took up a pen but stopped before he had begun to write you are sure you will say nothing to cause her distress he asked she has suffered enough poor child already trust me he looked into the calm blue eyes and went on with his writing the note in an envelope he rang for a messenger and despatched it when came he met her in another apartment and revealed to her the situation she begged for some time that he would not ask her to see but finally consented and the two girls came into each other s presence an hour later found them with their arms about each other s necks as he had seen them a thousand times in the old contented days we understand everything said with her finger on her lips and there is nothing more to say as he looked at them thus the feeling of the past came back foi an instant he wanted both of them and dreaded the opening of the door that was to send one away but he looked again at and knew she was the only one whose loss he could not bear have been telling your wife said and she saw that both of them shrank as if she had as heave struck them that you ought not to think of returning to the united states for another year if you dislike to waste the time you should have devoted to study it is easy to send for a box of law books and read at your leisure there are ,1,Arthur Conan Doyle

made glad to hear the noon signal sit down he added presently it is surely more comfortable here than out of doors as the lad feebly took a chair whispered to himself for the third time i think he is the most picturesque boy i ever saw the air of the counting room was undoubtedly to that of the street but the youth had something to think of beside his temporary comfort you are very kind said he but i cannot remain long i must find work to day somewhere looked at the slight figure there was much determination in its bearing an appearance entirely at with its slight bulk he had found very dull for the past month and this was the first thing that had in the least entertained him he wanted to retain the sensation what a a creature like this would be in that desolate region let me make a suggestion he said after a slight pause i am obliged to stay in this village and i am simply dying of in saying this i am making a confession to you with which i would not honor anyone else for the world you might suppose to look at me that i was the most contented chap on earth but the fact is i am just the opposite now i live at the hotel and have no one to talk to in the whole place unless it be some idiot like the book keeper with whom you have just had a bit of experience i want you to come up to the house with me and remain there picturesque and awhile as my guest i will not insult you by offering a salary for i want to treat you as one gentleman treats another what do you say a notion that this well dressed man was making fun of him came into the lad s head but he could see nothing to the idea in the straightforward glance that met his inquiring gaze i cannot accept your offer said he though i thank you for it it is absolutely necessary that i lose no time in getting employment was evidently disappointed and so you prefer work to taking your ease excuse me for saying that such a choice is quite incomprehensible i cannot see why anybody should want to work i have always thought it one of the ways of passing one s time even than sitting by this grate and watching the release themselves from that the lad stared at the speaker in great astonishment i have no friends no home no money he replied and his voice faltered what can i do but work the young gentleman could not take his eyes from the handsome fellow it was an outrage that such a picturesque specimen should be condemned to a life of what can you do he echoed why i have just told you have you never read that brilliant saying of s he says the only fitting occupation for a civilized man is to do nothing it at the lad shook his head in wonder he heard but he did not understand the idea that a person with empty pockets could live without labor was a new one to him if you really insist on working do not let me detain you added as his companion gave no sign of intending to reply it is easy to see though that you were never intended for a you are not built with a great rough frame feet and broad hands you are handsome excuse me and you have intelligence in your eyes it is ridiculous to think of you coal or iron or even grinding and yet that is what the of these works would probably have set you to do if there had been any place to offer you instead of replying in words the clad figure rose as if to take its leave you haven t told me your name said his brain to invent some means of keeping his new companion a little longer was the hesitating answer you look as if you had been ill remarked kindly i have then that is another reason why you should not think of doing anything like manual labor for the present don t be foolish come up to the hotel and dine with me after dinner we can talk it over this offer was declined with a motion of the head and another step was taken toward the doorway you are the strangest mortal i ever met picturesque and smiled advancing and placing one of his hands on the other s shoulder i will not oppose you any longer as it is evidently useless sit down again and wait until one o clock i will say the right word to the and he will employ you here there was a moment of hesitation and then the lad responded that he would rather go elsewhere there is no place here that book keeper told me so he said i could not take a place from which some one had to be discharged to make room for me looked much annoyed i say master you won t be able to keep that pace up he folks who persist in working for their living cannot be so particular that is one of the disagreeable things about the business you had better take this situation or a lunch or some money or something

wife without a word of apology the easy chair is no king james and is more likely to issue of tobacco than against it but king james belonged to a very selfish sex â a sex which tobacco and manners seems often to suppose that its and habits are to be tenderly for no other reason than that they are its habits therefore the young woman must defend herself by showing plainly that she the intrusion of which if suffered she is really the victim in other times the easy chair has seen the lovely unwilling to refuse to dance with the partner who had her hand for the german although when he presented himself he was plainly flown with wine the easy chair has seen the foolish maid encircled by those arms and then a headlong whirl and dash down the room ending in the overthrow and of maid and if in the day the morals were wanting it was something to have the manners they at least were to the imagination a memory and a prophecy they recalled the age when fine manners expressed fine feelings and they foretold the return of to her ancient haunts here is young dreaming of a four in hand and a like any other gentleman let us hope that he knows the test of a gentleman not to be the of blood horses and a unique drag but perfect courtesy founded upon fine human feeling â that rare and indescribable gentleness and consideration which rests upon manner as lightly as the bloom upon a fruit it may be as gold and diamonds are but no can harm it and it is with smoking in a lady s face even if she september tobacco and manners came in the other morning and announced to the easy chair that it had been made by common consent of a dispute in a circle of young men the question said he is not a new one in itself but it constantly for it is the inquiry under what conditions a gentleman may smoke in the presence of ladies the easy chair replied that it could not answer more than in the words of the famous princess who upon being asked by a youth who was attending her in a around the garden what should you say if a gentleman asked to smoke as he walked with you replied it is not for no gentleman would propose it s naturally that youth did not venture to light even a had his question so that although the rebuke was he could not even pretend to be his question was merely a form of saying i am about to smoke and what have you to say that he asked the question was evidence of a lingering persuasion inherited from an of gentlemen that it was not to e tobacco smoke around a lady with whom he was walking was silent for a moment as if reflecting whether this anecdote was to be regarded as a general judgment of the that a gentleman will never smoke in the presence of a lady but the easy chair broke in upon his meditation with a question if you had a son should you wish to meet him smoking as he accompanied tobacco and manners a lady upon the avenue or were you the father of a daughter should you wish to see her smoking as he walked by her side upon your own theory of what is gentlemanly and courteous and respectful and becoming in the manner of a man towards a woman should you regard the spectacle with satisfaction well replied isn t that rather a high flying view when can a man smoke â but you are not answering interrupted the easy chair of two youths walking with your daughter one of whom was smoking a or a cigar or a pipe as he attended her and the other was not smoking which would seem to you the more gentlemanly the latter said promptly and frankly it appears then returned the easy o chair assuming the manner that there are circumstances under which a gentleman will not smoke in the presence of a lady but to answer your question directly it is not possible to an exact code although certain conditions may be definitely stated for instance a gentleman will not smoke while walking with a lady in the street he will not smoke while paying her an evening visit in her drawing room he will not smoke while driving with her in the park it is significant of a radical change in manners that such rules can be laid down because formerly the question could not have arisen the grandfather of who was the flower of courtesy could no more have smoked with a lady with whom he was walking or driving than he could have attended her without a coat or collar yet man tobacco and manners change and the grandfather must not insist that those of his time were best because they were those of his time it is but a little while since that a gentleman who appeared at a party without gloves would have been a queer figure but now should he wear gloves he would be remarked as with good usage it does not argue a decline of courtesy that the compliment and the bending over a lady s hand and respectful kissing of the finger tips have yielded to a and less stately manner the woman of the was not really more respected than the woman of the however the word gentlemanly may be defined it will not be questioned that the quality which it describes is sympathetic regard for the feelings of others and the manner which it the manner of course may be and put to base uses to say that has a gentlemanly manner is not to say that he is a gentleman but only that he has caught the ,16,Rudyard Kipling

a husband like mrs s for instance who acts before every one as if she might escape into the air if he took his eyes from her one moment i cannot see why marriage should destroy the individuality the right to be herself that ought to be sacred to every woman if i had a husband who tried to be my master i could not live with him long it must be an equal otherwise the wife is little better than a slave the father looked at the speaker with eyes she had surprised him several times of late with her but he was more than astounded to hear such elaborate views on the marriage relation from those lips she must have been reading a lecture by b or attending a woman s rights if she had been more intimate with her brother he might have supposed that charles had imparted these thoughts to her mr is

argument one straw whether it is or labor the honest has invested in the essential if i live by the sale of my labour and if i spend five hundred hours labour on a production the sale of which is to that labour and pay the debt i have incurred to my butcher baker etc by thus applying my labour the who a similar article from france and makes it english with fifty hours labour can sell it at a profit nine times cheaper than i can sell it without going to and so he elbows the honest out of the dramatic market and drives him elsewhere men of genius will not in any number so apply their labour as to go to prison for it and that would be the probable fate of and should they come back to earth and endeavour to live by writing original plays in england under the and the a single such might live but not half a dozen and take notice englishmen can all see this where any nation but england is the we warned she would her literature if she played the same game in all literature we are playing in dramatic literature she persisted and did her literature what is the difference between her and england none in our favour the only vital difference is this first she did not and with but did her like a man and we do it like a secondly she has lately read a noble and we have not has formally and feeling that she has suppressed invention as we continue to do english invention she is now giving the artificial encouragement has just offered for native productions in or french upon a scale i learn from the times april that the higher are to be for the in french on account of the severe competition the must face in that language daylight breaking in thus you see common sense and uncommon honesty have dawned on and why not on ours when i was at in there were eight hundred painters in the town and not twenty writers of these painters two or three hundred would have made better writ the eighth ers than painters eight hundred to twenty â that proportion was never in nature the of was a deal of paper and a sight of canvas there will not waste their brains with thieves invention is too hard and laborious too and easy then some people ask me do you really think giving the french property in his works would make so great a difference i don t think it know it it would make a wonderful difference it would destroy fences prices at present a selling to a manager is literally a thief selling to a fence or of stolen goods the last i i talked with a thief who had stolen five thousand pounds worth of i asked him what the fence had given him for them thirty pounds sir said he â the average price of a new play in many flourishing london theatres is now four pounds this was given in evidence in the case of shepherd v and i will find twenty witnesses to to the truth of it on oath before either house of parliament this it seems was employed by messrs shepherd and to go to paris and appropriate pieces from the french authors he improved on his instructions he not only appropriated from his but from his kept a ms and went and one of these pieces to mr conquest of the so much for laws which sap the great foundations of morality and hope that only a part of the house will tumble down this same writer by no means devoid of talent sold two pieces out and out to a provincial manager of my acquaintance for one pound a piece on and me for five hunted pounds i wrote and asked the provincial whether that sum was the price of the muse i received from most of them marks of sympathy highly honourable to them for which i now publicly thank ti em and beg them to command me in return they furnished me with a mass of documents which i should like to lay before parliament they would answer a nobler purpose than that i got them for they prove that does nobody any good drives away the and the the eighth here they lie on my desk committed on smaller than on they feed and to what end three separate lists of plays from sixty to one hundred in number offered to a manager for thirty shillings and one pound per here is five hundred pound himself selling ve new pieces out and out with the for three pounds to one manager and offering himself and a female relation as actors together with all his pieces for three pounds per week to another see the evidence t he sold his version of my piece ms and all to the victoria for two pounds i had to pay three pounds fifteen shillings to a for a copy of it thus does the fine arts above the mechanical arts and now mark here is one of the selling what i happen to know to have been an original english composition for two pounds another poor devil sends a ms also original for thirty shillings and if not approved offers to write another and another and another sooner than a rival shall win the thirty shillings but for and the system of fences prices it has introduced he would have had fifteen pounds for it they are starving themselves as well as the and disgusting the better class of spectators n b when a turns honest for a moment and falls on him he gets only the price of stolen goods for his invention compare all this and much more to the same tune which i once more offer to lay upon oath before ,9,Jane

at the club on whose books he had been temporarily inscribed he was regarded as a most desirable companion the number of his new friends was only limited by the list of received once or twice he had accompanied mr to private houses where he himself as might have been expected with full credit the wanted a young gentleman of good appearance and education who would do no to any circle of life and he congratulated himself that he had found him you are doubtless still in a state of wonder as to what this all means he said one night when they were riding home from a brilliant party at one of london houses yes said are you going to tell me the looked at his companion perhaps he replied cautiously let me however ask you in the first place if you are tired of the life you are leading the young man shook his head decidedly love gone astray and you would perhaps prefer to have it continue rather than return to the one you were following when i met you in park a ghastly shade came upon the young face at the mere suggestion i thought so said mr not waiting for a more definite reply well mr gray i have a proposal that only requires acceptance and then as pleasant a life as you have passed with me yes a much pleasanter one is yours for the rest of your days a dim recollection came to the younger man of a story he had read in which the devil demanded the soul of a mortal in exchange for all earthly blessings he wondered if beneath the dress coat of the a tail was concealed and if within his patent leather boots there were hoofs instead ol feet i am listening he answered catching his breath to come at once to the point then you will be required to marry caught his breath again an faced old maid he asked with a shiver on the contrary a young and very beautiful girl with some terrible mental defect no with a bright brain and an disposition the breathing grew easier to marry such a girl and still enjoy life was a conceivable possibility i am listening he said again this young girl will inherit a fortune her you ll be required to band will be placed beyond want at the beginning of his married life the family is highly respectable is is there anything else that you wish to know mr gray was staring with all his might out of the carriage window it is very mysterious he remarked to this the assented with a bow when must the wedding take place immediately this year to morrow there was a gasp that of alarm and then the youth into deep thought what could it mean something had not yet been told him there was some reason to marry a pretty girl with a fortune was not a fate men usually struggled to avoid nor was it necessary to a man into society on semi false to find one who would accept the hand of such a lady but to look at the other side of the question what would result from declining this offer simply to be turned out into the street with ten pounds advance wages in his pocket and starvation to face again it was clearly a case where a gift horse must not be looked too closely in the mouth and yet he felt how thoroughly this plan if carried out would affect all his future that future for which in happier days he had built up a home by the side of some woman whose love he had won and whose hand he had gained in no such way as this he began to talk to mr of the marriage he had had in mind of the of that association and its importance upon character love gone and even as he talked the of the argument overcame him when it was compared with the situation in which he was placed that situation into which he had been so unexpectedly plunged and which altered everything do you accept was the business like question with which the smiling mr met these when the speaker came to an end of them accept echoed with a start perhaps after all i shall do so if you would only give me a day or two to think not an hour it is impossible well then said gray breathing deeply and after a long pause unless there is some reason stronger than any you have advanced why i should not i i yes i accept the hand of the strayed over and clasped his with a motion that indicated eminent satisfaction it would be idle for me to attempt to convince you he said that the proposition i have made is exactly what it appears on its face you have divined that there is a thorn with the rose a fly in the soup as the french say that makes the matter a little

and to show how he would have answered the question the class is then ready to appreciate qualities which might be to them in vain before they have set their minds to the problem in the examples i have given no one has touched for instance upon the suggest of the words and ind but very little is needed to make them see this after thej have had the passage in an examination paper a couple of examples dealing with the first two of s destruction of may be by way of showing how a different selection was treated talks on teaching literature the first thing i noticed in reading the t was the perfect you cannot read the extract without to say it aloud then the choice of struck me the of their when is green it is hard for me to distinguish workman thought and imagination i cannot tell whether the words and used in the extract were the result of deliberate choice and of long thought but i strongly suspect that he the whole thing in his imagination and the just came to him it is hard to understand how anything that reads so smoothly could have been written with labor the strongest point of the extract seems to be its richness in illustration tlie came down hke the wolf on tlie fold no long detailed description could explain better the of such an attack the sudden of some half striking suddenly and then disappearing into the night the of the was like stars on the sea the flash from a spear would be just such a gleam as the reflected star from the crest of a wave visible for a moment and then gone some of its excellent points of are melody and selection of words the melody is excellent it has a soothing effect when read aloud and there is not a place where one would hesitate in regard to the of words i the melody ia so good that a person only knowing the of the first line could almost read the rest of it correctly the sound of each line is so closely connected with that of all other lines the selection of words is very good there ia not a place where a could he made which would improve the meaning sense or melody the extract shows great thought in the last paragraph especially where tlie are compared to the leaves of and in no better bring out more how badly the host was defeated in the first paragraph it also the to a wolf coming down upon a this gives a definite idea and seems to point out how confident they were of victory the imagination is very vivid yon can almost think yon were on the field and that all the events were taking place before yon i have copied these partly to the point that it is idle to expect too much and partly to illustrate the form in which genuine perception is likely to work out upon a school these have not been chosen as the best papers written but each is good because each sincere this sort of question is of course in the i what ia constantly done in class but it is after all a different thing when it is made to the idea that an examination is a test of the power to appreciate literature instead of an exercise of memory xi the study of â method iii teaching is properly the ef the personality of a given teacher to the of a given class it cannot be defined by hard and fast rules and the only value in present ing such illustrations as the following is that they may afford hints which teachers will be able with advantage to develop in terms of their own individuality the way that is wise in one is never to be set down as the way best for another and here as elsewhere i not a model but simply an illustration if it suggest it has fulfilled a better purpose than if it were taken blindly as a rigid guide my own feeling would be that classes in literature should be provided with nothing but the bare text without notes of any kind unless with a of terms not to be found in available of reference in the matter of looking up difficulties the books of reference in the school library should bo used aud if the school has no library beyond the dictionary i should still hold to my opinion the may be very largely worked out with any fairly comprehensive dictionary and what cannot be discovered in this way is better taken the study of prose in than swallowed from without even the of asking much will be done moreover by the not spirit of which is sure to exist where the pupils are set to use their wits and to report the result in class they will remember much better and what in general education is of the very first importance they will have admirable practice in the use of books of reference many difficulties must be explained by the teacher but this i insist is better than the following of notes a habit which is sure to into lifeless the model text for school use be in those few passages not suited for the school room be clearly printed and would be as free as possible from any outside matter whatever in the case of poetry the ideal method would be to keep the text out of the hands of the student altogether until all work necessary to the of the â had been done but in practice such voluntary reading as a pupil chose to do beforehand would do no harm other than possibly to his attention from the learning of the meaning of words and phrases in prose he will generally be in a key which allows the interruption of a ,3,Charles Dickens

with poison as soon as the went his way and it was a week before he left his rooms in the meantime recovered enough to ride out but not enough to see her husband except at table dr was very grave when but would not say much the also had a solemn look the whole affair wore on until it seemed sometimes as if he would go frantic you ll have me on your hands too if this goes on much longer he said to at the end of a month mr viewed the changed aspect of things with an interested face he told at last that if he were in his place he would take a little run out of town and pull himself together you could go to the hills with your rod and gun he said and no one would find any fault i d speak to your wife about it before the day is over as long as she is under a physician s care she can t object at first protested with vigor that he would do nothing of the kind when his wife was ill he wasn t going to be accused of running into the woods to enjoy himself it would look hard hearted and i there

when i described his looks she thought he might be her dead father s secretary â for she then believed her father was dead she wished to see him but always kept out of her sight then when anne went to mrs he still continued to dog me he got to know a concert hall where i frequently sang and hired himself there as an attendant then he took to sending me love letters i was angry at first afterwards i wondered if he know anything about and thought he must if he really was the secretary as anne said i asked him to come here said the princess you have behaved badly s evidence tf has all turned out for the best responded wearily she was beginning to show signs of fatigue again but still kept on with her explanation in the most manner came he is a handsome young fellow and was well dressed i led him on to talk about anne he told me more than he should have done told you what that had come in for money and was living at as i knew from anne about the money i put two and two together and concluded that was pretending to be anne s father that she was really my half sister and that her pretended father had really murdered to get the money as but how did you know about this asked why replied much surprised at his i read the case in the papers i knew that anne could not have killed and having settled in my own mind that she was not s daughter from her resemblance to me i decided that who lived at the and had the money was really my mother s enemy i sent for my mother she came over went down to and recognized that is all wait a minute said quickly what about your telling steel to look after well mr ware it was this way she answered when you came to me and talked about the scarlet cross i remembered that had such a one on his watch chain the of the gang of course but i did not know that until later then steel came in if you remember and hinted that the red cross was the symbol of such a gang your talk of the cross being found in the church and that you thought a coin of edward vii it was dropped by the criminal set me thinking i sent for again and tried to find out the truth at first he refused saying it was as much as his hfe was worth to talk and i he is right would not stick at a second murder by the way did you know he was only when confessed i gradually got him to be confidential to me promising that he would not get into trouble he was so deeply in love with me that he spoke out at last my dear well mother i knew if i could get at the truth i could save anne the princess nodded well pleased i am glad you thought of your sister flushed a deep red and her eyes sought those of it was not my sister i thought of but of myself she said in a low tone you see mother i fancied that i might get something if i could prove the innocence of anne for i is any explanation needed said uneasily she paused for a moment and looked at him no she said at length that is all over i think no more explanation need be made but with regard to he told me that had come to england to see about the money left to he disguised himself as and lodged at a mrs s then he went down to and and murdered interposed eagerly so i said mr ware but who seems devoted in a way to that he struck the blow does he know who did no he says doesn t know either s evidence s a bigger scoundrel than you think said recalling his last conversation at the he anne of the girl he ll have to prove it then said coolly while her mother shrieked i ll be able to save anne never fear however told me that the red cross was the of a thieves gang had a called the red cross which goes from one port to another to take stolen goods on board that s what steel says of course told him when he him with it the boy for he is just twenty five told me everything and you told steel said ware rather reproachfully i had to tell steel if i wished to save anne retorted but i asked him to do nothing to the liberty of mark did he promise that yes saw him in i told him to call with a note which i gave him did not know why he was sent and when he discovered that steel was a he became afraid i believe he told something but he afterwards ran away he doesn t trust you any longer perhaps said the princess from his attitude last night i think he does although he was a trifle he will come if steel has written a letter to call him here in my name then i he will be able to explain why he took anne away will he do so ah that is what we must find out paused then continued i wanted steel to learn all he could it a coin of edward vii from about as i wish to see that man arrested nothing would give me greater pleasure cried the princess i thought of that tried to ruin your mother and he did â he did she said bitterly he tried or rather he is trying to ruin anne also said for these reasons i wish steel to find evidence against him so that ,12,Mark Twain
friend extended pale and lifeless on the carpet she turned on george with a furious face what have you been doing to the poor darling she demanded you she raised her hand to strike but caught her by the wrist i have been doing nothing he declared the rage of the she bear by the power of his glance miss bull fainted unexpectedly thank goodness here is some one it was one of the servants but waved her off no one but me â no one but me she cried and took the slender form of her friend up in her arms wait here she added to george i ll be down soon when she left the room george looked at the servant who was a quiet respectable old woman is that girl mad he asked she s queer poor soul sir replied the woman and entirely devoted to miss bull and well she may be for it is miss bull who the house the girl is a natural sir the red man she looks like it replied george sitting down you can go i shall wait here until miss bull yes sir the woman and departed but as she closed the door george heard her muttering something to herself the danger of s claws scratching him did not feel very comfortable on this point himself he saw that was a kind of animal who had been brought into by miss bull no other person could manage her and should she return still in a passion feared lest she should use physical violence still he held his ground as he was anxious to learn how the old maid was feeling and still more anxious to find out if possible why she had fainted on hearing his name i wonder if mrs told her anything muttered george as he looked out of the window but that s impossible mrs would keep her own secret so as to over besides miss bull declared that she recognized my face i wonder if she knew my father and if she can throw any light on the murder it is strange that she should be connected with the matter and in the same house as mrs upon my word said george in disgust it seems as though there were a gang of shady people here connected with my affairs and she was moved by the mention of s name i wonder what that meant but whatever it did mean he did not learn that day returned and stated that miss bull was better but was too faint to resume the conversation she begged mr to call another day gave this message in quite a friendly way and nodded to the astonished george you are better disposed toward me he said taking up his hat the yellow miss bull told me to be kind to you she declared still smiling and then with a burst of good nature i will be kind do you want to know about the papers if you choose to tell me said george but rejoicing at the opportunity this offered of learning something yes i do choose said she asked me to be kind to you well then tell me george her there was a lease in the green box and many bills said a few photographs and that was all i couldn t see the story what story miss nodded with a cunning smile and answered in a whisper as though her aunt was still and within hearing she told me it was a story she was writing oh such a long story sheets and sheets of a story â sheets she kept them in a long blue envelope and would not let me see them george reflected that evidently mrs had been writing out an account of her early life and s next words put the matter beyond a doubt my aunt said that she would let me have the story to read after she died but i could not find it in the green box perhaps you did not look thoroughly suggested george yes i did and i looked in all other places but i could not find it the story was italian went on staring at him for when my aunt wasn t looking i peeped san is in italy isn t it i believe so replied george more and more convinced that mrs had left a confession behind her did you tell miss bull the red man nodded she said i wasn t to say a word about it but she will not be angry at my telling you she likes you and says you are like some one she once knew and loved did not pursue the conversation he was afraid lest might say too much and miss bull might be angry and it was necessary that he should keep on good terms with miss bull evidently she had known his father she may even have loved him but george had heard so much that day that his brain was quite bewildered and he wanted to be alone to think the matter out only one last request he made of will you show me the photographs which were in the green box he asked i can t she replied drawing down her lip a child miss bull has them but she ll show them to you brightening for she likes you i like you too you are so handsome with a laugh and a blush at this compliment george left the house promising to call again with his head filled with many thoughts consequent on his two he emerged from square and walked down to oxford street a shout aroused him from his day dreams as he reached the corner he saw a tall red headed man crossing the road and a cab was bearing down on him the man stood in the and it was apparent that the horse would soon be on him ,12,Mark Twain
disturbed at losing it i don t know why she should have been said she must have guessed that i had taken it and would send it back oh by the way you may as well put this into it i opened the case for a and found this it fell out and he passed along the coral hand mrs s dead white face flushed and her black eyes glittered i am glad that is not lost she said eagerly it was this that was anxious about is it some ornament to which some value i fancy h m is it the of any society mrs s flush face faded to a white why do you ask asked a question in his turn did tell you what i came to see her about no never anyone s confidence but i heard your story you heard it stepped back a pace in his astonishment yes said mrs coldly and slipping the case along with the coral hand into her pocket i was asleep on the sofa in the other room which is as you know divided from the drawing room by curtains i woke to hear what you said about that girl and major in the interests of my daughter i listened and you intend to tell major no asked me to hold my tongue and no the sealed message indeed would do so for your own sake major is an ill man to with threw back his head i am not afraid of he said in a haughty tone i went to see him to day to explain myself but he is in gone to see his unfortunate ward i expect when he returns i shall demand an explanation he may not give it to you said mrs up her mouth he must i love and i intend to marry her but if she is mad she is not mad and well mrs there is no use in my talking to you on the matter i did wrong to speak to about it since she is to marry major will hold her tongue as she promised and so shall i thank you both replied courteously but there will be no need after to morrow i intend to see as i said to learn what to learn said why he up his ward seeing that she is not in my opinion insane also to learn why who watches herself in the s house i heard you talk of the woman said mrs in her manner and i presume that stops in the s house because she is major s servant there is more in it than that came to see major this very day and came also here to me since she knows that i have visited is terrified out of her life because of some people who seek her life when she saw that coral hand which was the sealed message iii lying by chance on the she rushed away me of being in league with some society to kill her at least that was what i gathered from what she said but it was sheer i think so indeed said mrs quietly this coral hand is merely an ornament given by whom you met to day to it means nothing so think no more about it but when she departed did think and it was little wonder that he did so chapter xi the other girl during the next three days found ample time to reflect upon the strange circumstances which him anxious to see the major and place affairs on a proper basis he called thrice at his rooms on the first occasion he learned that had not returned to london on the second it appeared that he had come back but was absent visiting mrs while on the final occasion was told by the that his master had gone again to and would not return for at least a week he had left no message said the man from this circumstance inferred that was afraid of the interview it then struck him and very naturally that as the major during his hurried stay in town had called upon mrs the widow had broken her promise if this was the case had been placed on his guard and so not only avoided but had gone back to the s house to make arrangements for the young man s curiosity therefore paid a visit the sealed message to court only to learn that the widow and her mother had departed for on a month s holiday it was thus apparent that in these two quarters could do nothing for the moment and indeed the more thought about the matters the more difficult did it appear to set them straight if he saw and the major held to the story of his ward s madness â as he assuredly would â felt that for some time at all events he could do nothing of course if his theory about the will proved to be correct and if he could be certain that was shutting up in order to enjoy an income which should be hers then he could take steps to have the matter inquired into to make any beginning at all it was necessary to see so determined to look him up just as he did so the morning post brought a sunday supper invitation from mrs this was what would have called a coincidence but believing that nothing happened by chance saw in the incident a sign pointing to the path he should tread directed by the unseen powers who were he believed about to the mystery he had not to see or mrs immediately nor had he to proceed at once to his duty was to visit mrs s flat and learn what he could about charity bird if she was related in any way to â and the likeness between the two girls hinted as he ,12,Mark Twain

m had made a similar discovery and that both these gentlemen were at or on the way there lost in admiration of the excellent qualities of these individuals i inquired how they had obtained possession of all these facts by a free use of said a to and its answer proved that you had left there another to showed that m had taken passage on a steamer for another sent yesterday to showed that you were both at the hotel de paris could anything be more simple nothing could i was obliged to acknowledge it follows from your statement i said that m and his friend are here there was an instant of on ihe part of m i that out unwillingly he said il can make no difference m and his friend were here naturally when he sent the at ihe moment they are at m in relation to the you made the sprang lo my forehead i am obliged to confess that i made thai under a great error i replied i have left a explanation to that effect col you will remember i that i believed m the father of miss of s child until my interview with him i still held that opinion which i am now certain is when i told m i was laboring under that delusion sprang to his feet and uttered a cry and you meant that and that only by what you said of him to m he exclaimed that and thai only i answered surprised al his another word he strode at a quick pace from the room leaving me for several minutes alone you have astonished me intensely said when he returned perhaps your explanation has come in time to prevent a very proceeding perhaps on the contrary it not i have sent a message to m and his friend he took out his watch and consulted it carefully it is a close he continued but we will hope for the i at the speaker there could not have been much harm done i stammered they would have read my written statement and that would have ended the they might and they might not was the quiet reply when a gentleman feels that all his finer have been when he hears one he considered his true friend has all the of where in short he is led to believe that a woman dearer to him than life itself has been degraded for the second time by a certain person he is in a condition of mind that does not easily accept explanations the gentleman of whom i speak is now with m in the city of con he is her husband if the train which took him there is on time he would not m in cold blood but he might give him such provocation that a could not be averted this was not pleasant to hear to say the least the murder for i could call it no less of an innocent man might be the result of my too hasty jump at an conclusion i was in a very nervous state and the recollection that miss was at the moment within a few hundred yards liable to meet some of these people and learn the truth did not add to my serenity but what did m mean by his wholly mysterious remark about the friend of m holding that lady dearer to him than life itself who could this unknown be that had conceived such a violent affection for miss a woman whose acquaintance with men had been of the most limited description i am at a loss to know i replied when i could get breath who can claim such a deep interest in my american friend he must have a very warm place in his heart for her to travel hundreds of miles merely for the sake of this meeting it was now the turn of to stare do you wish me to understand he asked slowly that you have no conception whatever as to who this gentleman is i have none was my positive answer then he said i will tell you for there is no longer any use in he is her husband i her husband whose husband i asked him feeling a blindness crossing my vision the husband of the lady you call ton out of i heard him distinctly enough but the words did not seem to have any definite meaning i had never connected the word husband with george s daughter and i could not do so now she who hated marriage who had it who had the of the whole world by her contempt of it who had drunk to the confusion of all wives who had the standard of free and independent husband s husband it could not be i think you are mistaken i managed to articulate at last non he responded sharply and there is nothing that means more than this expression

a horrid sight it was i turned my eyes to the floor and there i just by the table â a kind of bead i dropped my handkerchief so that might not suspect and i picked it up when in my own room i examined it it was one of the yellow mrs ward threw back with a kind of triumph do you know what you are saying mr train she said in a half whisper you are mr no no train started to his feet mrs ward pulled him down again and pointed with her fan toward the hush he might come out she whispered but can t you see wore the in his coat on that night he must have been in the room and have dropped the what was he doing there if it was not to no said train hoarsely i half thought of that myself but it is quite impossible i tell you he not have got out of his room unless he had come to me how do you mean i locked the door of the sitting room which was between his bedroom and mine there was no exit from his bedroom and to get out and down the stairs he would have had to open the sitting room the yellow door now the key was under my pillow and the door was locked in the morning no mrs ward is innocent he might have stolen the key while you slept train shook his head impossible i sleep very lightly and on that night i hardly slept at all why was anything wrong i can t tell you that mrs ward without the confidence of my friend indeed i have said too much promise me you will not speak of what i have told you i promise but i am quite e that the was dropped by george and that he was in mrs s sitting room on that night he is the criminal i tell you he is not mrs ward don t excite yourself mr train here is mr and she sailed toward them with open hands finished your talk we must say good night and to herself she murmured while smiling i ve got you at last â i ve got you at last and shook hands with madame quite unconscious of her treachery chapter xi mr at home under the rule of miss for a mere figure head â the house in square was much more most of the old had departed as their nerves would not permit them to stop in a dwelling wherein a crime had been committed mrs carried her knitting to her sister s house at mr took the death of to a boarding house on hill and went to his antiquity at some german in place of these ancient creatures came bright young men and girls who were up to date in every way none of them minded about the crime the house was cheap it was now bright and in a few months the tragedy was almost forgotten no one would have recognized the changed atmosphere of the place save for miss bull who still sat nightly playing patience in her favorite corner so little did she mind the horror of the der that she took up her abode in madame s where it had happened she stiu retained her own bedroom and kept hers but the sitting room miss bull found very pleasant for she ask her friends into it for afternoon tea without having to mix with the too lively in the drawing room and the majority of them were extremely lively so much so that miss bull sent several away and checked the spirits of the yellow the others the girls played the men sang music hall and in they tried to but miss bull soon put a stop to that she had no notion that the house should get a bad name after her difficulty in obtaining the lease from lord of course in spite of the fast air which certainly pervaded the house all things were very proper miss bull was a lady and saw that things were kept decent the feared her bright black eyes and her sharp tongue and were always glad when she retired to her sitting room when they too noisy the little old maid would appear like an ghost and the would die away but miss bull was also liked as she was a very hostess she was thoroughly happy now as she had what she most desired â power and thought like satan that it was better to rule in a certain place than to serve in the higher was now as ever her slave and miss governed with a rod of iron she dismissed some of the servants among them who had himself by becoming a page boy in a west end mansion among the new miss bull took most notice of who occupied the rooms formerly inhabited by train on his arrival he had asked particularly for these rooms saying that he had once lived in them when he stopped with mrs many years before after some thought miss bull remembered the man he had in the house and had been a great favorite with madame but had later gone to america and for some time had remained away he expressed the greatest sorrow for the death of the old lady but declared that he was very pleased with the house as managed by mr at home miss bull the little woman liked him as his was amusing and he was most polite but had she known that he was a private inquiry agent she might not have approved of him so much miss bull was a lady and drew the line at what was she never inquired as she was the least curious of women his were certainly eccentric for sometimes he would remain away for a week and at ,12,Mark Twain
i looked at the coat i had a strange sensation i was sure that i had once worn that coat it was my wedding â long in the skirts â which had told me years and years before she had given away to the jew beggar she had ever seen the figure in my fancy â the features lost their antique grandeur and the restless eye ceased to be sublime from immortal and became only lively with mean cunning the apparition was fearfully grotesque but the driving ship and the mysterious company gradually restored its tragic interest i stopped and leaned against the side and heard the rippling water that i could not see and flitting through the mist with anxious speed the figure held its way what was he flying what conscience with sting pricked this victim on he came again nearer and nearer to me in his walk i with disgust this time no less than terror but he seemed resolved to speak and finally each time as he passed me he asked single questions as a ship which fires whenever it can bring a gun to bear can you tell me to what port we are bound no i replied but how came you to take passage without inquiry to me it makes little difference nor do i care he answered when he next came near enough i have already been there where asked i wherever we are going he replied i have been there a great many times and oh i am very tired of it but why are you here at all then and why don t you stop there was a singular mixture of a hundred conflicting emotions in his face as i spoke the representative grandeur of a race which he sometimes showed in his look faded into a glance of hopeless and despair his eyes looked at me curiously his chest heaved and there was clearly a struggle in his mind between some lofty and mean desire at times i saw only the austere suffering of ages in his features and again i could see nothing but the second hand black hat above them he rubbed his forehead with his hand he glanced over his shoulder as if calculating whether he had time to speak to me and then as a splendid defiance flashed from his piercing eyes so that i know how milton s satan looked he said bitterly and with hopeless sorrow that no mortal voice ever knew before i cannot stop my woe is infinite like my sin â and he passed into the mist but in a few moments he reappeared i could now see only the hat which sank more and more over his face until it covered it entirely and i heard a voice which seemed to be quarrelling with itself for saying what it was compelled to say so that the words were even more appalling than what it had said before old old i gazed at the disappearing figure in speechless amazement and was still looking when i was tapped upon the shoulder and turning round saw a german cavalry officer with a heavy and a in his hand most extraordinary man your friend yonder said the officer i don t remember to have seen him in turkey and yet i recognize upon his feet the boots that i wore in the great russian cavalry charge where i rode down five hundred and thirty seven hundred at a moderate by the mere force of my rush and taking the seven walls of at one clean flying leap rode straight into the and dropping the bridle cut the s throat with my bridle hand kissed the other to the ladies of the and was back again within our lines and taking a glass of wine with the hereditary grand duke before he knew that i had mounted oddly enough your old friend is now sporting the identical boots i wore on that occasion the cavalry officer coolly curled his with his fingers i looked at him in silence speaking of boots he resumed i don t remember to have told you of that little incident of the princess of the s diamonds it was slight but curious i was dining one day with the emperor of the who always had a cover laid for me at his table when he said in great perplexity baron my boy i am in straits the of has just sent me word that he has presented me with two thousand pearl of and i don t know how to get them over the duties are so heavy nothing easier replied i i ll bring them in my boots nonsense said the emperor of the nonsense yourself replied i for the of the always gives me my joke and so after dinner i went over to the thing was easily enough done i ordered a hundred thousand pairs of boots or so filled them with pearls said at the custom house that they were part of my private wardrobe and i had left the blocks in to keep them stretched for i was particular about my the officers bowed and said that their own feet were tender upon which i remarked that i wished their were and so in the manner possible the were bowed out of and the emperor of the gave me three thousand of them as my share it was no trouble it was only ordering the boots and whistling to the infernal of to hang for their pay i could reply nothing to my new acquaintance but i his stories to tell to and at length summoned courage to ask him why he had taken passage pure fun answered he nothing else under the sun you see it happened in this way i was sitting quietly and swinging in a of on the very summit of that mountain when suddenly feeling a little warm i took ,16,Rudyard Kipling

the who came at one o clock to lock up and take the keys saw a strange sight along the household goods were piled to the for many rods women and children some on chairs others on were discussing the prospect for the next night s lodgings an im meals were being served in the most primitive style several of the little ones were crying as if from a that the consequences to them one or two aged com in a high key that they were taken from comfortable rooms and pitched like loads of coal into the but most of the were strangely â almost suspiciously â passive and so the reported that afternoon to the agent did not himself go down town he could imagine how things looked there without an demon he stayed at the agency thinking he might have a call from some committee or other body of citizens and not wishing to be found away from his post and he was not mistaken about four o clock his bell rang and a moment later a servant entered the drawing room to say that a of his ex was outside and desired to see him ask them to come in he said but the servant returned after delivering this request with the information that the did not wish to enter and would like to have him come to the door a momentary suspicion of foul play crossed his mind but he would not yield to it his feelings he arose and went out on the front where he found ten or twelve persons among whom he noticed at the first glance and my friends he said in a firm voice i am told that you wish to see me and refuse to enter my house i presume you are a committee of the ex of the great central mills if this be so i would like to ask why you decline to confer with me in my office where you and your associates have so often been for similar purposes there was a pause and all the other members of thâ committee looked to when she raised her beautiful eyes to meet those of the agent they affected him powerfully for an instant his gaze was withdrawn from the group and he lost his having been consigned sir she said in her ordinary tone but with deep earnestness to the streets of by the order of agent we would not presume to intrude upon the floor of his home if the air is good enough for us to spend the day in it should suffice for the brief interview which we desire by your direction nearly five hundred persons are many of them are weak women and helpless children a night in the open air would be injurious possibly fatal to some of them the town authorities have not yet consented to allow us shelter we have heard that their hesitation is from fear of offending so powerful a personage as yourself we come to ask if agent has intimated a wish that the people of shall find to night not only their late homes but the public closed against them the agent had time to collect himself during this statement and when he replied he spoke like a man of iron agent does not understand by what right your committee to question him after your people had deserted their places in the mills for six weeks after most of them were in for over a month s rent he asked possession of his houses not one of the men for whom you speak cared enough about retaining his home to come and seek the employment that has never yet been refused him to day part of the buildings have been given up to their owners and i am glad to learn in a manner before the end of the week the rest will i trust be i am not as air official of your town but only of the mill and my interest ceases when its commands are obeyed heard him without taking her eyes from his face may we say to the town officials that agent does not object to their giving shelter to his ex he answered her without moving a muscle i shall be here as i have been for the past six weeks ready to business with if your has any proper question to ask me in reference to the attitude of the great central it will find me ready but if the town authorities of are in ignorance o f their duty which i should hesitate to believe they must apply elsewhere than to me â either in person or by â for the information as he closed the faint sound of a shouting crowd came borne on the air from the direction of the railroad station mingled it seemed with the just beating of drums the conference was suspended in the curiosity felt by all at this unexpected occurrence left the and accompanied the committee to the street where they could see first a large number of boys running backward and forward across the highway then a rush of people on both of the and then in the middle of the street a drum corps and a body of â the entire party marching in direction a few minutes later several companies of soldiers were halted in front of the agency by their commander who immediately came toward and politely asked to see him in private the crowd now half the population of pressed forward to hear what was said spoke loud enough for all to understand you can have no private conversation with me of colonel if there is anything to be said to m in the discharge of your duty

about the part of the individual in the general scheme of things was like certain oriental doctrines i have read since his death and i suppose he may have been influenced by the writings of the east he seemed to feel that he was part of a process and that the lives of those who sometime would come after him might be made easier and happier if he lived well and wisely i am sure he was right i do not know how or where or when the accounts of life are settled or whether it makes any difference to the individual as an individual or not but i am sure what we do is of consequence and i wish my life might be as fine as strong as noble as was father s september aunt came in this with her step and seated herself by the south window in the sunshine the only eye which could be seen clearly was bright with intention and it was evident at a glance that she had things to say she was rather deliberate in coming at it aunt is an artist in gossip and never spoils the effect of what she has to tell by failing to arouse expectation the of a saint and interest she leads one on and np curiosity before she tells her news and with so much cleverness does she manage that a very tiny bit of gossip will seem a good deal when she has set it forth it is a pleasure to see anything well done even gossip so aunt is an source of amusement to me â which is perhaps not to my credit she made the usual remarks about the weather and asked after baby she observed that from the way miss breathed when she was asleep in prayer meeting last night she was afraid she had taken cold she told me s wife was at death s door again and tried to get from me some sort of information of s feelings toward the possible then she gradually and approached her real subject it s strange how folks get over being in love when once they are married she said her chair into the sunlight which had moved a little from her while she talked i knew by her careless tone too careless not to be that something was coming but i would not help her i simply smiled vaguely and asked where the sewing circle was to be next week she was not disconcerted by the question but neatly turned it to her uses at mrs s she answered i hope we shan t see anything unpleasant across the road what do you mean i asked rather startled at this plain allusion to george s house they say george and his wife do rather queer things sometimes i asked her at once to say exactly what she meant and not to play with it i added that i did not see september why george and his wife should be so much discussed they are talked about because they deserve it returned evidently delighted by the effect she had produced if they will quarrel so all the neighborhood can hear and see of course people will talk about it why shouldn t they we ought to take some interest in folks i should think i was silent a minute i wanted to know why she said this and what george and his wife had been doing to make the village comment but i would not go on about them and i dropped the subject altogether i made a remark about the fair aunt chuckled audibly but she did not persist in talking about the september is once more in a state of excitement and the household is stirred goes about with her head in the air and an expression of the most lofty scorn on her face naturally this attitude both of mind and of body so i have to act as a sort of between the two the fuss is about again i begin to feel that i should be justified in having him and carried off to some far country but i hardly see my way clear to measures so extreme i am astonished to find that aunt did not know all the facts about the illness of s wife or perhaps she was too much occupied with the affairs of the to tell the whole seems this time to have got into real difficulty and apparently as the result of his latest is likely to pay a visit to the of a saint the county jail it seems that while he was pretty far gone in liquor ex mrs came to plead with him to take her back and marry her over again she having had the difficulty in getting from him in the first place one would think she might be content to let well enough alone but she is evidently madly fond of who must be a good deal of an in his own world so completely does he sway the hearts of the women even though they know him to be brutal drunken and generally worthless on this occasion behaved worse than

sails that flashed upon the horizon while the expressions chased each other over his placid face as if it reflected the calm and changing sea before him his morning costume was an ample dressing gown of silk and his morning was very apt to last all day he rarely read but he paced the great for hours with his hands buried deep in the pockets of his dressing gown and an air of sweet reverie which any book must be a very entertaining one to produce society of course he saw little there was some slight apprehension that if he were to social he might forget his coat or arrive without some other essential part of his dress and there is a sly tradition in the family that once having been invited to a ball in honor of a new governor of the island my grandfather sauntered into the hall towards midnight wrapped in the gorgeous flowers of his and with his hands buried in the pockets as usual there was great excitement among the guests and immense of ire fortunately it happened that the governor and my grandfather were old friends and there was no offence but as they were conversing together one of the distressed cast indignant at the brilliant costume of i grandfather who summoned him and asked courteously did you invite me or my coat you in a proper coat said the manager the governor smiled and looked at my grandfather my friend said he to the manager i beg your pardon i forgot the next day my grandfather was seen in full ball dress along the streets of the httle town they ought to know said he that i have a proper coat and that not contempt nor poverty but forgetfulness sent me to a ball in my dressing gown he did not much frequent social after this failure but he always told the story with satisfaction and a quiet smile to a stranger life upon those little islands is uniform even to weariness but the old native like my grandfather in the prolonged sunshine like the upon the banks nor know of existence more desirable life in the i take to be a placid during the long warm mornings of nearly half a century my grandfather had sat in his dressing gown and gazed at the sea but one calm june day as he slowly paced the after breakfast his dreamy glance was arrested by a little vessel evidently the shore he called for his spy glass and surveying the craft saw that she came from the neighboring island she glided smoothly slowly over the summer sea the warm morning air was sweet with and silent with heat the sea sparkled languidly and the brilliant blue sky hung over scores of little island vessels had my grandfather seen coming over the horizon and cast anchor in the port hundreds of sum mornings had the white sails flashed and faded like vague faces through forgotten dreams but this time he laid down the spy glass and leaned against a column of the and watched the vessel with an that he could not explain she came nearer and nearer a graceful spectacle in the dazzling morning decidedly i must step down and see about that vessel said ray grandfather i he gathered his ample dressing gown about him and stepped from the with no other protection from the sun than the little smoking cap upon his head his face wore a calm beaming smile as if he loved the whole world he was not an old man but there was almost a pathos in his expression as he sauntered along in the sunshine towards shore a group of idle ers was collected to w the arrival the little vi her sails and dr slowly and as was of very light she came close to tl shore a plank was put out from her side and the commenced my grandfather stood looking on to see the passengers as they passed there were but a few of them and mostly from the neighboring island but suddenly the face of a young girl appeared over the side of the vessel and she stepped upon the plank to descend my grandfather instantly advanced and moving briskly reached the top of the plank at the same moment and with the old of his cap flashing in the sun and one hand in the pocket of his dressing gown with the other he handed the young lady carefully down the plank that young lady was afterwards my grandmother for over the gleaming sea which he had watched so long and which seemed thus to reward his patient gaze came his bride that sunny morning of course we are happy he used to say to her after they were married for you are the gift of the sun i have loved so long and so well and my grandfather would lay his hand so tenderly upon the golden hair of his young bride that you could fancy him a devout caressing there were endless upon occasion of the marriage and my grandfather did not go to one of them in his the gentle sweetness of his wife melted every earth into love and sympathy he was much older than she without doubt but age as he used to say with a smile of immortal youth is a matter of feeling not of years and if sometimes as she sat by his side on the her fancy looked through her eyes upon that summer sea and saw a younger lover perhaps some one of those graceful and glowing heroes who occupy the of all young maidens visions by the sea yet she could not find one more generous and gracious nor fancy one more worthy and loving than my grandfather and if in the midnight while he lay calmly sleeping she leaned out of the window and sank into vague of sweet possibility and ,16,Rudyard Kipling

in london came into our family through an uncle who fought at and is supposed to be a happiness on the possessor of course i attach no importance to such superstition but i am anxious that the ring should come once more into the possession of our family if the ring is yours i will certainly get it for you major you swear it i swear it if you get it for me it will be the best day s work you ever did said the major yes i am not a poor man and when it is on my finger i will give you sufficient money to enable you to marry miss i will give you thousands of pounds really said somewhat puzzled by his eagerness this ring must be very valuable only to me only to me replied eagerly i assure you the ring is worthless to any other person i have neither nor child and i have taken a fancy to you so get me the ring and you can take all my fortune my dear i don t want your fortune said in an annoyed tone if the ring m yours you are the person to whom it should go i will ask for it to night and bring it to you to morrow morning do not mention my name to why not because he will guess that you intend to give me the ring and will then refuse it let him think an extraordinary coincidence you want it for yourself and then you hand it over to me i will do my best major come to morrow morning and if possible i will place the ring on your thank you my dear thank you one good turn deserves another so as i saved you from suicide you can surely gratify a harmless fancy of mine besides i will aid you by every means in my power to marry miss i am afraid you can help but little said as the major rose to go i m not so sure about that said the major significantly i have influence with lord as you will find laughed at this as he hardly thought the major was a man likely to be a favorite with the fastidious nobleman however he the major in his supposition and they parted on very good terms after had taken himself off remained in a brown study for some considerable time i wonder said he to himself aloud why he is so anxious to gain possession of that ring the fact is he was beginning to be suspicious of the major as it appeared absurd that he should show emotion over such a paltry as he the ring to be when a man offers thousands of pounds for a that must have other than an value and the major s story of its being a family jewel hardly seemed plausible in london enough had promised to obtain the ring for the major but he also promised himself to find out the truth about it before handing it over to the man who desired it so eagerly i have not promised to leave the major s name out of the conversation said after some thought and as i have heard s story of the ring i would like to hear s if the two stories i will give the major his ring â if not â he paused and with a thoughtful look on his face returned to lie down on the sofa clearly major was not so sure of the ring as he thought himself to be chapter v the at t that day felt restless and ill at ease the position in which he now found himself placed was so extraordinary that he could not but see that this was a critical moment of his life he refused to believe that all these things were due to chance only rather did they look like some carefully laid plot which he was unconsciously carrying out for the benefit of some person that person was either or and not make up his mind which of the two to suspect s suggestion had led him to and was the very person whom the major desired to discover what if it was all out beforehand â at least so far as the major was concerned suggested a ridiculous experiment and in the most extraordinary manner it had resulted to his own advantage this seemed to be rather due to design than to chance altogether had grave doubts on the subject and began to suspect that was making use of him to recover the ring on which he set such store the solution of the mystery lay with and fully made up his mind to know everything when he went to that night as to in london giving the ring it depended entirely on what was told to him by the mention of the major s name would be enough to put the old man on his guard and had not bound himself to leave the name out of his conversation in any event things seemed likely to turn out to his advantage for declared he would give thousands for the ring and even if refused to give it up there was a strong possibility that he would assist to a fortune never had felt so upset and he was glad when the long day drew to a close bringing nearer the time of his appointment several times he had felt inclined to call on and tell her of these strange events but he knew well enough that as lord had forbidden him the house he would probably be refused admission as he was about such he nevertheless found comfort in the thought that on reading his letter would certainly refuse to give a direct answer that day if therefore he gained any advantage from his second visit to he would still her free to become his ,12,Mark Twain

everything to put his at his ease and there was nothing to indicate to th young miss giddy that she had ever given him an instant of uneasiness how long have you been in new she asked nearly a

don t seem to have any strength and i cannot bear the least cold however i think home is the best place for me and i am trying to persuade them to take me back he felt easier when he heard this and his face grew probably your illness is only temporary at least we must hope so said he a great point in such cases i believe is faith and courage she laughed that strange little laugh again let s not talk about it she said tell me of your travels instead you have been gone from home a long time and must have seen much both had forgotten the spectacle on the stage and the hundreds of people who

flush i wanted to be free so i only brought papa s and my maid i think if you will be kind enough to assist me to the door i will let get the carriage it is early to be sure but i shall be better off at the hotel i am afraid a glance at the young lady s face showed that she had grown paler even since he had been sitting with her he made no excuse for delay but took her on his arm and escorted her to the neighborhood of a dressing room into which she went to find during the little the slight figure of the s daughter was very near to that of mr her bare arm pressed heavily upon his her head drooped toward his shoulder she evidently needed the assistance he was giving her what little things affect our entire future lives could never feel in reference to as he had felt before after that brief walk from her seat to the door of that dressing room the young man waited patiently for at least ten minutes till the girl re appeared in company with her maid then for a minute longer while

ball was understood to be in the most striking contrast to the one he had just left no woman laying any claim to virtue major had said would be allowed in the hall it was to be an imitation so far as

to go down into the dark under the castle the man in the moon the old harry and william of the would be valuable additions and the might compose an official upon the occasion or i would ask they to say all about it of course there are many other guests whose names i do not at the moment recall but i should invite first of all miles who knows everything about these places and this society for he was at and he has described a select party which he attended at a castle in the air has not yet looked over the list in fact i am not quite sure that she knows my intention for i wish to surprise her and i think it would be generous to ask to lead her out in the i think that i shall try the first with the girl i sometimes seem to see in my castle but whom i very vaguely remember will come with old and but i have not prepared half my invitations do you not guess it seeing that i did not name first of all who assisted at the upon the new year s coming of age and yet if should never marry â or if we could not get to spain â or if the company would not come what then shall i betray a secret i have already entertained this party in my humble little parlor at home and presided as serenely as over her court have i not said that i defy time and shall space hope to me i keep books by day but by night books keep me they leave me to dreams and shall i confess that sometimes when i have been sitting reading to my â perhaps or a tale â i have seemed to see clearly before me the broad highway to my castles in spain and as she looked up from her work and smiled in sympathy i have even fancied that i was already there sea from shore of i sails of the purple dropping down in the month of june and i like to walk upon the battery towards sunset and watch the crowded with passengers bound for the pleasant places along the coast where people pass the hot months sea lodgings are not very comfortable i am told but who would not willingly be a little pinched in his chamber if his windows looked upon the sea in such praises of the ocean do i indulge at such times and so respectfully do i regard the sailors who may chance to pass that often says with her shrewd smiles that my mind is a kind of hospital full of marine hopes and wishes broken legged intentions blind regrets and desires whose hands have been shot away in some hard battle of experience so that they cannot grasp the results towards which they reach she is right as usual such hopes and intentions do lie ruined and hopeless now strewn about the placid contentment of my mental life as the old sit about the grounds at and musing in the quiet morning sunshine many a one among them thinks what a he would have been if both his legs had not been carried away or in what a of triumph he would have ended if unfortunately he had not happened to have been blown blind by the explosion of that unlucky magazine so i dream sometimes of a straight scarlet collar stiff with gold lace around my neck instead of this limp white and i have even my at the office so cut ass wise that has paused in his additions and looked at me as if he doubted whether i should come out quite square in my petty cash yet he understands it was born in that is the secret of my fondness for the sea i was born by it not more surely do pine for the mountains or for the sound of bow bells than those who are bom within sight and sound of the ocean to return to it and renew their in dreams the children of the sea hear its voice i have read in some book travels that certain tribes of ar have no name for the ocean a that when they came to the for the first time they asked with eager sadness as if penetrated by the conviction of a superior beauty what is that desert of water more beautiful than the land and in the of german stories which and the other children read and into which i occasionally look in the evening when they are gone to bed â for i like to know what interests my children â i find that the who do not live near the sea love the fairy lore of water and tell the sweet stories of and as if they had especial charm for them because their country is inland we who know the sea have less fairy feeling about it but our realities are romance my earliest are of a long range of old half stores stores with steep wooden roofs and stone window frames and door frames which stood upon built as if for immense trade with all quarters of the globe generally there were only a few to the tremendous posts which i fancied could easily hold fast a spanish in a tropical but sometimes a great ship an east with rusty sides and dingy sails came slowly moving up the harbor with an air of indolent self importance and consciousness of superiority which inspired me with profound respect if the ship had ever chanced to run down a row boat or

me considerably i wanted to know how it had got into the study of lodge when i knew that i could nail my man but there was considerable difficulty to overcome before such knowledge was available now a curiosity of this kind is not a common object in this country a man who owns one must have come from new or have obtained it from a new friend he could not have picked it up in london if he did he would not carry it about with him it was therefore my idea that the murderer had received the idol from a friend on the day of the crime that friend to possess such an idol must have been in communication with the chain of thought is somewhat complicated but it began with curiosity about the idol and ended in my looking up the list of going to the then i carried out a little design which need not be mentioned at this moment in due time it will fit in with the hanging of mrs s meanwhile i followed up the clue of the bank notes and left the green stone idol to its own destiny thus i had two strings to my bow the crime was committed on the twentieth of june and on the twenty third two fifty pound notes with numbers corresponding to those stolen were paid into the bank of england i was astonished at the little care exercised by the criminal in concealing his crime but still more so when i learned that the money had been by a very respectable furnished with the address i called on this gentleman mr received me politely and he had no hesitation in telling me how the notes had come the stone god and the his possession i did state my reason for the inquiry i hope there is no trouble about these notes said he hen i explained my errand i have had sufficient already looking up the list of indeed mr and in what way for answer he touched the bell and when it was answered mr foi d to step this way he said then turning to me i must reveal what i had hoped to keep the green stone god and the secret but i trust the revelation will remain with yourself that is as i may decide after hearing it i am a mr and you may be sure i do not make these inquiries out of idle curiosity before he could reply a slender weak looking young man excited entered the room this was ford and he looked from me to with some apprehension this gentleman said his employer not comes from scotland yard about the money you paid me two days ago it is all right i hope stammered ford turning red and pale and red again where did you get the money i asked this question from my sister i started when i heard this answer and with good reason my inquiries about e had revealed that he was in love with a hospital nurse whose name was ford without doubt she had obtained the notes from after he had stolen them from lodge but why the necessity of the robbery why did you get a hundred pounds from your sister i asked ford he did not answer but looked at that gentleman interposed we must make a clean breast of it ford he said with a sigh if you have committed a second crime to conceal the first i cannot help you this time matters are not at my discretion i have committed no crime said ford desperately turning to me sir i may as well admit that i one hundred pounds from mr to pay a gambling debt he kindly and most generously consented to overlook the if i replaced the money not having it myself i asked my sister she a poor hospital nurse the stone god and the liad not the amount yet as non payment meant ruin to me she a mr to help her he at once agreed to do bo and gave her two fifty pound notes she handed them to me and i gave them to mr who paid them into the bank this then was the reason of s remark he did not refer to hia own ruin but to that of ford to save a this man and for love of the sister he bad committed the crime i did not need to see but at once made up my mind to arrest the case was perfectly clear and i was fully justified in taking this course meanwhile i made and hia clerk promise silence as i did not wish to be put on his guard by miss ford through her brother the green stone god and the gentlemen i said after a few moments pause i cannot at present explain my reasons for asking these questions as it would take too long and i have no time to lose keep silent about this interview till to morrow and by that time you shall know all has ford got into fresh trouble asked anxiously no but some one else has my sister began ford faintly when i interrupted him at once your sister is all right mr ford pray trust in my discretion no harm shall come to her or to you if i can help it â but above all be silent this they readily promised and i returned to scotland yard quite satisfied that would get no warning the evidence was so clear that i could not doubt the guilt of else how had he come in possession of the notes already there was sufficient proof to hang him yet i hoped to the certainty by proving his of the green stone idol it did not belong to or to his dead wife yet some one must have brought it into the study why not who to ,12,Mark Twain

i ve been only once to see her she said a good deal about it s being the duty of us â she said us my dear â to wake up this sleepy old place i told her that personally since she was good enough to include me with herself i preferred the town as it had been i fairly laughed out at the idea of old lady delivering this with well bred sweetness and i wondered how far mrs perceived the sarcasm did she understand i asked about half i think my dear she saw she had made a mistake but i doubt if she quite knew what it was she was uneasy and said she thought those who had a chance ought to make things more lively i asked if mrs gave any definite idea how this was to be secured not very clearly was the answer she said something about hoping soon to have a larger house june she entertain properly her dress was dreadfully according to my old fashioned notions i am afraid we are too slow for her my dear she will have to make a more modem society for herself and so the social doom of george s wife is written as far as i can see i can if i choose ask people to meet her but that will do her little good when they have looked her over and given her up they will come to my house to meet anybody i select but they will not invite her in their turn it is a pity social distinctions should count for so much but in they certainly do june mr called again this afternoon he is so thin and so pale that it is always my inclination to have bring him something to eat at to day he had an especially nervous air and i tried in vain to set him at his ease i fear he may have taken it into his head to try to bring me into the church he did not it is true say anything directly about religion but he had an air of having something very important in reserve which he waa not yet ready to speak of he talked about the church work as if he expected me to be interested he would not have come so soon again if he did not have some particular object it is a pity anything so noble as religion should so often have weak men to represent it what is good in religion they do not fairly stand for and what is they somehow make more evident if superstition is to be a help it must appeal to the best feelings and a weak priest touches only the weaker side of character one is not able to receive him on the of a saint his merits as a man but has to excuse him in the name of his devotion to religion still mr is a good man and he means well with whatever strength of mind nature endowed him june tom came to day to see baby â not that he paid much attention to her when he saw her it me to find how jealous i am getting for and anxious she be treated with deference i see myself rapidly growing into a hen with attitude of mind but i do not know how it is to be helped i exhibited baby this afternoon with as much pride and as much desire that she should be admired a if she had been my own so it was no wonder that tom laughed at me he was very grave when he came but little by little the fun loving sparkle came into his eyes and a smile grew on his face you d make a first rate he said if you could show off goods as well as you do babies i suppose i can never meet tom again with the easy freedom we used to feel especially with baby to remind us but we have been good friends so long that it is a great comfort to feel something of the old to be still possible tom was so awkward about baby so unwilling to touch her that i offered to put her into his arms then he suddenly grew brave don t he said it hurts you that i can t care for the baby but i can t perhaps i shall sometime i took away without a word and gave june her to in the nursery when i came back to the parlor tom was in his favorite position before the window he wheeled round suddenly when he heard me you are not angry he asked no tom i answered only sorry i sat down and took up my sewing while he walked about the room he stopped in front of me after a moment i wanted to tell you he said that i am not going back to new york i looked at him and waited i had really a good opening there he went on but i thought i ought not to take it i asked him why i be hanged if i quite know he responded i suppose it s part obstinacy that makes me too stubborn to run away from disgrace and partly it s father this thing has broken him terribly i m going to stay and help him out i know how tom hates farming and i held out my hand to him and said so i hate everything he returned desperately but it would n t be square to leave him now when he s so cut up on my account we were both of us i am sure too moved to have much talk and tom did not stay long he went off rather abruptly with hardly a good by but i think i understood i am glad he has the pluck to stand by poor ,3,Charles Dickens
long since dead that i want you to begin as soon as possible to reap the benefits mr intended for you to this refused to listen though he began to think he had been rude to the man of the law he persisted that if mr had intended him to have two thousand five hundred dollars a year or any sum from his estate he would have made his will in that manner instead of that he should wait five years and then depend upon a he would have been glad now had the will read differently he did not like to be left face to face with poverty but his honor was in becoming a tact and he had not yet experienced that sharp contact with the world which it i will take nothing but what is mine he said in response to every argument but i owe you an apology for my manner of receiving the unpleasant news you broke to me yesterday and i make it freely and now can you think of any situation which i could fill for i want to with out delay to earn my bread mr after casting about in his mind a few moments said he could think of nothing at present but would make some inquiries in the meantime gray would do well to look about for himself with this understanding they parted at the end of a month though he had looked about with diligence had found absolutely nothing that he could do and his distress increased as he went from place to place and saw his for the positions offered he went to mr office again in a much frame of mind than before and told that gentleman frankly what had occurred this leads me to make you an offer on my own account said the lawyer gravely which i should otherwise have hesitated to do i am a very busy man and have now with mr s estate and others that are in my charge more than i can attend to just at present i think you could if you chose be of some assistance in caring for my trust property collecting rents seeing to etc as well as making journeys to various places and looking into matters that require attention for this work i am not able to offer you a large compensation but love gone astray it might keep you occupied until something better turns up i will take it gladly was the quick reply the prospect of earning anything whatever seeming too good to be lost you are very kind to make the proposition but to this mr saying it was wholly a business matter with him and he wanted it treated as such he was willing to pay fifteen dollars a week with necessary expense of travel etc and possibly the salary might be raised to twenty later gray seized upon the offer without more and it was arranged that he should begin his duties the very next morning never having had the slightest business experience it is doubtful if the young man ever really earned the meagre salary which he began to receive but he brought to the work an honesty of purpose and a of conduct if mr had been wholly in him the connection might have gone on much longer than it did to the mutual advantage of both the fact was however that the engagement was only a scheme on the lawyer s part for bringing gray to the agreement he had first suggested mr believed thoroughly that this was the only sensible thing for him to do and felt that the obstinacy with which he held out deserved to be overcome if he could reduce the youth to actual want and then give him no other alternative than to accept his offer he believed he would be doing him a real kindness but gray proved a subject to handle he lived after a fashion on the fifteen dollars a becoming a week that was paid him and all offers to take the first penny from his inheritance then who knew that mr had never believed his nephew alive and had only intended to give this young man a little experience of the value of money determined to force matters he therefore announced to gray one day that he should not need his services after the following week somewhat but not at all ready to give up looked about for another situation and soon heard of one at a fair salary in where a concern wanted just the sort of man he conceived himself to be one acquainted with america and able to talk a certain line of goods into americans travelling abroad correspondence passed and he was advised to come to

a month later i entered the house with came forward to greet us m in a wonderfully self possessed mood and introduced him to dr and mrs drew as my friend m that you have heard me speak of so often the frenchman much acknowledged the that he received and himself admirably if did not fall in love with him she was the only one of the household of whom that could be said seemed to like him immensely when left he received an invitation to call again the second time he was asked to remain to dinner and to bring with him you cannot imagine a party than we all made with this father mother and child at one table under the very strange circumstances of the case addressed her husband as and he called her madame the boy was not well enough in any language to talk a great deal or he might have complicated matters still more mrs drew was particularly sweet to followed her lead as usual dr was courteous to everybody but once in awhile i caught him throwing despairing looks at as if to ask her when she would end the part of this affair we managed to leave m and alone together more or less we guessed that there were things they might like to discuss in private but the he looks like door to the parlor they occupied on these occasions seemed to be purposely left open or at least in this way several weeks passed the brothers dined at the house nearly every day and usually remained most of the evening with at eleven o clock the visitors always took their leave my own rooms were in the direction of the hotel they occupied and we walked out together but nothing was said nothing by either of us one evening this was only a few weeks ago the clock struck the customary hour for leaving without having any perceptible effect on or her we waited ten minutes which seemed very long ones and still they did not come slightly but maintained silence five minutes more mrs drew rose and out of the room a moment later she returned with her eyes wide open and her parted oh she exclaimed what do you think i knocked gently and they did not answer and then i pushed open the door and well cried we all in one breath why was lying in his arms her face all wet with tears and and he was kissing fur f out or ready for the jury chapter and now suit yourselves mr paused and turned to me with a look that s t as clearly as words what have you got to say and he did not seem particularly flattered when i replied that his story had turned out precisely as i expected it would women are women after all i explained let them get as far as they may out of the paths followed by their inherited instincts are stronger than resolutions your friend will be madame the rest of her life and probably all the happier for the way she took to achieve her destiny the retired smiled with one of his triumphant expressions we don t know yet whether she will or not he said she still lives at her own house and he at his hotel nearly every day he comes to dinner and remains for the evening and sometimes she walks out with him but so far as we can see this is all she has given us no indication that she to change this manner of life in response to a direct question of mine just before i left new york she shook her head and now suit yourselves you are a man of sense i answered and you know this can t go on forever they are by your own account lovers and time will surely bind them closer mark my he raised a finger to stop me don t miss is a puzzle that those who know her best have found impossible of solution there is no doubt that she loves this frenchman but she has an fear of putting herself as she calls it in his power she is now free to love or to cease to love and she wishes to remain so she wants the right to live near him or to go to the farthest end of the earth to submit her lips to his kisses or to close them merely because she wills it she that breaks from a woman the wings that god placed between her shoulders and her to suit her pace to that of a man she may learn to dread like death to be sure she may change all of these views on the contrary she may not neither of us can tell that most women would change is no proof that she will for is not like other women i remarked that i wished miss or madame or whatever she elected to be called would make her decision and have done with it and i gave as my very good reason that i had a novel to write and wanted to use her history as its basis and could not wait a great while for the my readers especially the feminine ones i said will demand to know the result of this lady s peculiar doctrines or in other words how she came out mr replied that he had thought of that of he believed the best way was to write the story up to date the public a jury to try the case of the state they could argue it pro and con and fix up conclusions to suit their individual selves and in a subsequent story i could tell them what the real ending was after time had developed it the more i considered this idea the more i was pleased with

she feels somewhat sore at having to buy his services by accepting money he has placed himself without the pale others will be rewarded for the royal cause but not â he will receive his reward to night in hard cash new for old let us hope for his sake and for your own that the money will be paid i have no fear of that replied paradise it is now in the villa under the care of when m bids him

a talk with them said a chance of carrying out his plans i wish to know precisely what i am to do to night he walked up the steps and paradise looked after him with a doubtful smile i don t like that man he said abruptly to the duke why not he is of the same stamp as and would sacrifice us all to obtain his own ends i agree with you there but unlike he is not important enough to give us any trouble at such a crisis as this the least thing may prove fatal replied paradise with emphasis i distrust the tone of s conversation and will carefully watch his actions to night he is quite safe i doubt it the object of this conversation had now reached the great hall in which the ball was to take place in london and f in an animated to his wife all is ready major called out as advanced towards

with a smile at present my courage is up to the sticking point and i am too excited to feel weary but you seem to be completely worn out go up to your room and lie down or lie down here suggested pointing to the round the hall a good idea said throwing himself on the cushions i will snatch forty wait a minute before you close your eyes tell me of the arrangements to night new for old well all

am inclined to believe that you have some claim to belong to the family why yes doctor replied surprised at this correct interpretation of his thoughts i cannot deny that my mind has been busy with such a possibility on what grounds do you base this assumption questioned calmly i hardly know how to answer that question i have really only a vague belief without much foundation you know my story yes and a very interesting story it is i well as i mentioned it was not without design that t came to the village of said with some emphasis is not a common name well no replied and yet you can hardly say it is uncommon you refer to the man in london partly and to mistress sally also i have discovered that he was her brother was her brother yes he is now dead expressed no surprise at this intelligence so that was more convinced than ever that mistress sally had come on other than medical business to the after a pause said the doctor well sir of london is now dead and i presume you have given up all thought of discovering your real name and that of your father why no on the contrary i have now a reasonable expectation of learning the truth indeed i should be glad to know the grounds on which you base those expectations said he settled himself comfortably in his chair and looked anxiously at the young man hesitated for a few the dwarf s chamber moments then with a sudden resolution laid bare his mind with youthful though indeed said he with some i do not rightly see why i should confide in you seeing that you hold aloof and treat me with suspicion my dear lad i do not treat you with suspicion cried holding out his hand and i have a reason for holding aloof you will learn what it is soon enough meanwhile let me hear your story you already know most of it replied frankly as i told you my father recommended me to seek out this in london as one likely to aid me in the search for my family before i set off for london for the second time told me that he had reason to believe that came from and advised me to turn aside and see if he was there what reason had he to believe that indeed i cannot say i unless it was that in one of his he stayed at the arms which as you know is kept by miss the name might suggest a connection well sir continued warming with his theme i questioned mistress sally and learned but little yet i discovered that this of london â walter â was her brother what has that to do with the in my opinion it has a great deal to do with the retorted with some heat only to day madam while talking her nonsense mentioned incidentally that it was a pity her nephew had not what nephew you know well enough though it pleases you to assume ignorance i refer to the brother of the late louis the father of miss i don t quite follow your argument said however i will for the sake of further the dwarf s chamber sion that there was a nephew by which i suppose madam means a dwarf like herself what then what then can t you see the connection no i am very stupid indeed you are no such thing it is sheer obstinacy on your part however i shall explain my belief a dwarf was born to and unwilling to another in the secret chamber he took means to rid himself of the unfortunate i believe that this was given the dwarf to get rid of took the poor creature away and i verily believe sold him to who i see interrupted quietly you think that your father the dwarf was the son of lord and that you are the cousin of miss and the heir to the title and estates i congratulate you on your imagination mr do you find the idea so very ridiculous demanded angrily i confess i do not that a noble family like the should have children is to say the least of it remarkable these are not but are perfectly and gracefully formed â tiny men and women my father was the same he was as handsome a dwarf as madam the man who is supposed to know my history comes from this village he was i believe a confidential servant of the and further madam admits that a dwarf was born to her brother now dr all these facts make me believe that i am sprung from none other than the and what is more i believe lord knows it oh you think so replied i do else why should he treat me with such kindness after hearing my story i showed him the paper bearing the date of my father s birth and if madam is to be believed he must have known that he the dwarf s chamber had a dwarf child born that year again he wishes to see for what reason if not to question him concerning purchase of the child from with these facts â and they are facts â to go on can you wonder at my belief that i am really a rose from his seat with an embarrassed smile and took a turn up and down the room when he stopped it was before at whom he looked with some interest you are a very clever young man

this delicate topic could not reveal the cause of his friendship with without exposing the secret of the ring and although he had made up his mind to tell everything yet owing to the constant occurrence of exciting events in connection with the conspiracy the opportunity of so doing never took place it was therefore s firm resolve that should undertake the dangerous mission of gaining to

offered to him to secure the ring by fraud for never took the precious from his finger and it was useless to think of force seeing how was in guarding his master the indian suspected s designs and

pass how had their relations altered in the twinkling of an eye from those of ordinary friendship mingled with a certain element of distrust to the warmest and most that can exist between a man and a woman he was in a whirl of doubt as to whether he ought to be proud of what had occurred or very much ashamed the unusual manner in which his marriage had taken place the reasons that had naturally made him reserved in his wife s presence the acceptance on the part of both of them of the situation as it seemed to outline itself all came back to him then there was the tumultuous rush of blood to his head the clasping of that warm and yielding figure to his heart the forgetting of everything as he lay in his berth night after night he had but one wild overpowering wish that and not

depend on this the final merely told mr gray to use his judgment whatever that might be he felt as his mind grew stronger that he must accomplish something to justify the kindness and confidence in

the business of everybody else that was not easy to get for a man who held the wrong side of the a little was obtained in one place and a little in another but it only matters a trifle and the downward tendency continued to make all efforts seem useless when some days had passed and he had exhausted all his funds gray heard of a new firm of who were taking risks for those ready to pay exceptional figures in despair of finding what he wanted elsewhere he decided to pay the interest they were said to demand if he could get them to loan enough on the security he could give he was

that the wrong would be speedily and to what would this be due but to the fact that the selfishness of men would insist upon the comfort of which while the lasts they deprive women indeed if all men

watch nor chain there he said love gone astray ah for the third time and began to get upon his feet what time is it he asked yawning and gray delighted that the conversation had thus begun responded that it was between seven and eight o clock the man spoke english and was apparently a native of the british eight o clock he replied why it was after ten when he paused and contracted his eyebrows confound it i believe i ve slept here all night this looked so probable that the person to whom it was addressed only answered witli a smiling nod he had sized up the rapidly during the last minute

seriously from contact with a dry and reasonably clean pavement he brushed off the dust with care and then stretched himself again if you will excuse the liberty in a stranger said gray i was just going to get some coffee would you like to accompany me the englishman cast a quick look of suspicion at the speaker and then tried to conceal his action i suppose i am a curiosity to you said he and such i must at least for the present remain it would be folly to pretend that i selected this place for my nap on account of its comfort it in a was merely a matter of i did not have a in my pocket i could not my watch or chain or diamond pin or rings because i had none my very linen is held as security for rent i cannot pay with these statements i leave you to say whether you still wish my company or whether you would rather hand me a as yon would to any other and let me go all the generosity in gray s heart forbade the acceptance of the latter proposition the man had told him nothing but what he already suspected he replied quick y that his invitation still held good and that he trusted all disagreeable subjects would be banished from the slight refreshment of which they were to partake very well was the reply as they walked along toward s i will go with pleasure all the greater as it is twenty four hours since i tasted food to the exclamation which greeted this announcement the stranger added oh that is nothing if i were at liberty to tell you let me say only this i have been robbed my enemies have me and as you see they have left me in a rather disagreeable plight but my courage is still good and when my turn comes i shall pay them back with interest what may i call you asked handing his new acquaintance his card as they seated them selves at one of the tables i

occurred to mr gray would you mind he said if i ordered some eggs for you along with my own i am not yet used to continental and find need of something rather more substantial between morning and noon mr laughed i should certainly like the eggs he answered and for the sake of them will pardon the of your invitation ask the waiter to make it three if you please eating once a day has its but it certainly to a healthy appetite the manner in which the stranger received his new friend s advances made it easy to get on comfortable terms with him and the that had crept into s manner rapidly

kind of a trip quite but with no attempt to sacrifice truth to politeness you are evidently a he said i suppose you read and and that sort of thing i them was the enthusiastic reply and do you write verses yourself asked no it almost seems as if i could though i feel all a poet s without confidence enough to express it i think there is no place so poetic as these watery streets anywhere on the

you have a right to my confidence since you have forgiven my folly so kindly and i shall tell you that which hitherto i have revealed to no man my father â my father go on lad said kindly seeing the look in the lad s face who was your father bit his lip and stammered out the words with an effort he was a dwarf my lord astonished at so unexpected a reply turned pale and sank into his former seat with an which even his self control could not prevent soon his brow grew dark and he frowned at the young man you are mocking me sir no my lord i swear it is the truth responded with great emotion my father was a dwarf scarce it the dwarf s chamber higher than your poor sister who exhibited himself at fail for his he married one who called herself tt fair who made her living by showing he beauty to the crowd i am the offspring of the pair gasped with a painful of the i was â i was born in a but your speech your behaviour these do not with such humble birth my lord i was educated at a public school for over years my father was a great in the that he came of good stock and so desiring to give mc every advantage he spent what money he possessed in me to achieve a position in the world i was taken away while young and placed at the school i did not know the truth till two years ago when i finished my education then the money was spent my father and mother were dead and i was thrown on the world to support myself i took up the profession of a strolling rested his chin on his hand and looked straight at he saw perfectly well that the lad spoke truly and was overcome with shame at having to make so humiliating a confession him to stand up he looked at him long and earnestly and found it to believe that so well grown and graceful a lad could own a dwarf for a father a trifle beyond the ordinary stature he was slender and well made and in looks and he showed himself to be one with gentle blood in his veins a strange confession said slowly be seated mr and relate your story the dwarf s chamber chapter ix the tale op a nameless man could with the request of his host dr quietly entered the room but seeing e pair in deep conversation he hesitated to come forward t he should prove to be the inconvenient third noting s doubtful attitude addressed himself with courtesy to his young companion i trust mr you will have no objection to e presence of dr said he deliberately he is in my confidence and anything you may say is safe with him as with me not only have i no objection my lord but a promise by me to dr some days ago him to ar all i have to tell thus bowed and seated himself at s elbow when without further the â man proceeded to the story of his early as i said before my lord began directing s conversation more particularly to my father a dwarf and exhibited himself at and under the management of a man who called that as you may guess as taken from a drama of shakespeare s and was chosen on account of its to the profession him who assumed it he called himself and i he was known throughout the where he usually with his show this was a collection of as are to be found at every fair and the these were exhibited was a miserable ingenious structure which could be taken to pieces ad put together at will with this travelled the dwarf s chamber from fair to fair and made if not a fortune at least a comfortable he was a stout man who constantly wore a dirty white overcoat and a of crimson but in spite of his rough exterior he had a kindly heart and it is to him that i owe my education he paid for it i suppose mr no my lord but seeing that i was a lad of intelligence he suggested to my father that i should be sent to a public school which accordingly was done but this is said hastily as i have not told you of my father s marriage the show of resumed after a pause consisted of a fat woman a thin man my father the dwarf the fair who afterwards became my mother and a double headed these with a horse and a proved sufficiently attractive to the gaping and drew many a hardly earned penny from their pockets you smile my lord at my recital of so queer a company but notwithstanding their physical defects they were a kindly folk and amongst them i spent a happy infancy and childhood your pardon mr observed gently i did indeed smile but it was at the idea of a lad of your parts beginning existence amid such humble surroundings but for my education i might have also of their lot replied with a smile i had no claim to a higher position save in the imagination of my poor father who always cherished the dream that he came of a noble house and exchanged glances and the former opened his mouth as if to question the young man but his mind he made no remark and signed to him to continue his tale ignorant of this by play whose eyes were fixed

pause for looking up words much injury to the effect of the work the study of prose is of course directed by same principles as that of poetry but the tion is in school work somewhat modified in details in the first place the of any prose used talks on literature in tbe is not likely to contain words as are found in shakespeare and in the second place the length of a its read aloud in in its i have taken my illustrations chiefly from books included in tho because these books are the ones with which the majority of teachers are obliged to work the sir de papers are sure to be taken up in any school room where literature is studied to day and on is one of the inevitable obstacles in the way of every boy who wishes to enter college whatever the work however the thing is that pupil shall understand shall appreciate and shall connect what he reads with his own life the in w hi ch works are taken up in class is a matter of much no rules can be given to govern the arrangement of the since much depends upon the class to be dealt with on general principles for instance it might seem that s speech as being the least imaginative of the prescribed work might well come first but on the other hand the argument demands intellectual capacity and maturity which will often require that it be not put before a given group of scholars until they have had all the training they can gain from the other a can hardly afford to have any rule in the treatment of literature is not so that it may be modified or tbe study of prose entirely circumstances require the ideal method perhaps would be to give a class first a few short pieces as and then to arrange their longer work upon the of the result if the speech is to be taken up first or last it must be preceded by a clear understanding of the h y of t h e conditions ft dealt this knowledge should have been obtained in the history class and the use of facts obtained in another branch affords one of the opportunities for doing that useful thing which should be kept always in sight the of the fact that ail is one although for convenience of handling necessarily divided into various branches if the class has not had the requisite instruction in history the teacher of english is forced to pause and supply the deficiency as it is hopeless to try to go on without it the argument of is pretty tough work for any class of high school students and without familiarity with the circumstances which called it forth ia utterly unintelligible the vo of contains few words which need to be studied and tl it ia perhaps better to treat the speech as so far a logical rather than an imaginative work that without other preparation than a thorough mastery of the circumstances under which it was delivered and of the political issues with which it dealt the class may be given the text directly in the first reading the thing to be is the intelligent comprehension of the language and of the argument talks on teaching literature in the â dozen for instance passages as these be made perfectly clear i hope sir that the of the your good nature will incline you to degree of indulgence toward human the grand bill to us from the house we are not at all embarrassed unless we please to make ourselves so by any mixture of and restraint from being blown about by every wind of fashionable doctrine this is clear enough in meaning but the class should notice the of the phrase which that a good deal of the political which has complicated the question of tlie treatment of the colonies has been like the of those who run after every fresh offered in the name of religion i really did not think it safe or manly to have fresh principles to seek upon every fresh mail that should arrive from america it is in your to parliament having an ed view of objects a situation which i will not which i dare not name that the public never too indulgent to a long and opposition would now oar conduct with unusual severity we must produce our hand somewhat the study of prose the whole is with passages such as these and it is the habit of too many to expect the student to depend upon notes for the solution of such i have already indicated that i believe this to be an unwise and process and in a political document of this sort a for difficulties may well be undertaken when in an imaginative work more latitude may be allowed in the way of sliding over them the reading of the speech as a whole could hardly be attempted with any profit until the class has mastered its and its logic the in this from more imaginative literature here it la not only proper but necessary to â make analysis part of the first reading the class should for make a summary of t he as it goes forward for each paragraph should be devised a single sentence which gives ly and the thought so that at the conclusion a complete skeleton shall have been made each student should make these sentences for himself as part of his preparation of a lesson and from a comparison in the class the final form may be selected some of the school do this admirably hut one of two things seems to me either the speech is too difficult for students to

his chamber that his agency was in a fair way to make a good thing and when got this far he generally had a pretty clear idea of what he was talking about while his coffee in dressing gown and slippers he had the morning paper brought to him he glanced over its columns rapidly with the trained eye a sugar princess of an expert pausing occasionally for a second or two at some piece of news suddenly he chanced upon one which caused even his steady head to he caught his breath several times as he read and re read the that his attention putting down the paper at last he rang for hot water and proceeded leisurely to himself when this was done he wrote a brief note to his partner asking him to call on him before going to the office mr had never known the test to fail he did not wish mr to see that he had undergone the least trace of excitement the of the showed that he could appear as calm as an notwithstanding the temptation to show the reason why he had sent for his partner was that he wished to consult with him alone and knew that would be certain to put in an early appearance at the office when mr appeared he did not look in the least like the dear to the readers of fiction he was on the contrary apparently an sort of who might have been a or dealer he seemed a combination of earnestness and the of force but of the kind when he was admitted he did not the least curiosity as to why he had been summoned he merely uttered a conventional good morning and took a seat it s affair of peter s said speaking with the nephew was in to see me last night a sugar princess mr listened but made no remark he s been hunting for the old man in the natural channels and had an idea that he d been or murdered i m going to take the case on speculation have you seen the morning papers mr shook his head well listen to this he read aloud an occurred in the bay yesterday afternoon which happily resulted in worse than a scare and for a party of people a containing mr william van miss van miss and mr s was run not far from house by the lucky through what seems to been criminal carelessness all the people mentioned were thrown water but were luckily rescued by the and a young man whose name has not been ascertained the van are of the family well known in and miss van recently from miss s school on the heights mr listened attentively enough but his face gave no sign that he found the paragraph particularly exciting well he remarked at last just this the young man s name has been me and he is the nephew of his uncle queer was the quiet remark of the other man it would be in any business but ours now i should say this young man had best be left to me to manage a sugar princess as you please how is he off for funds pretty short and you ll let him get a little shorter naturally mr s face softened into something almost like a smile is there anything else asked mr no i only suggest that the boy had better not see you around the office if you can come an hour or two late for the present i will get rid of him before you arrive no reply was needed to this and mr took his leave as silently as he had made his appearance an hour later when mr entered his business rooms he found there as he expected the young man looked the eager inquiry that was in his mind you had quite an adventure yesterday said a very slight one but about mr have you learned anything i think i can assure you that he is alive and safe where asked breathless it may several days before i can answer that positively a dis look filled the anxious eyes have you formed any theory as to his strange ence other than the spoke hoarsely the one you advanced yesterday mr nodded like a man to whom all secrets were that t i have done though i can bring as yet n absolute proof i think he has gone insane uttered a quick exclamation of dismay a sugar princess that would not account for mr disappearing also he suggested yes it would at present i do not care to say too much in relation to the matter i have set on foot which will reveal something in a few days till then i must ask you to have patience a few days may not seem long in ordinary matters but the time was likely to be wearisome enough at that juncture s funds were nearly exhausted he had nothing left that would bring if with the uncertainty that hung over him he could not engage himself at any occupation he was on a barren rock from which he did not even dare depart should any friendly sail come hi sight except the one he most longed for come in any morning at this hour continued mr not later as i am very busy i have your address if anything important occurs i will send for you good day nothing could be gained by confiding to this man of steel the extreme of his resources and left the office much arriving at his room his heart gave a bound to find that a letter had arrived bearing his name and also the printed address of the lawyer of st louis eagerly he tore open the envelope but the contents were merely formal no news of mr or his companion had been received wrote principally to say this ,1,Arthur Conan Doyle

learning so they wrote their report and in it expressed their conviction that the system on the whole worked admirably they noticed the incident of s suicide but attached no significance and little importance to it out of a hundred and eighty prisoners there would be a few in one way or another under the system bat on the whole the system worked well system s wheels were well and so long as they were well it did not matter their crushing one or two besides the crushed were only prisoners â the refuse of society they reported the governor mr as a active zealous officer and now mr was called in â the report was read to him â and he bowed laid his hand upon his and presented a picture of modest merit surprised by unexpected praise from a l quarter next mr was requested to me the report sent

appearance that becomes a judge trying a prisoner with this difference that his manner was not harsh or but just such as to reveal his vast superiority and irresistible weight in a solemn tone with a touch of pity he began thus i am sorry to mr that grave charges are laid against you in the prison give yourself no uneasiness ou my account sir replied mr politely they are perhaps false yet they come from one who has means of knowing â from the governor mr â ah then they are sure to be false we shall see four sundays ago you preached a sermon â two bat one was against â it is never too late to mend ty â it was the other handled mr himself to have been ont and exposed by that sermon â why so there are more than thirty cruel men in this jail besides him then this sermon was not aimed at

try also to forget chapter xiv good night mrs thoroughly under the influence of her husband agreed with but slight resistance to the departure of the young couple a little in advance of us as she put it for the exact date she was to follow was not yet arranged she troubled mr gray when he came for his good by covert allusions to the natural desire of young married people to be away from their elders where they could enjoy with absolute freedom the society of each other she had once been of their age she told them and her memory was good ah they should make the most of their youth and their love for years crept on and there would be an end to all things earthly if only their affection grew brighter with the lapse of time as hers and her husband s had done they could ask for nothing sweeter and to this play of words and lent themselves with whatever was necessary to deceive while the sober face of colonel with its new lines of pain and care even when it encouraged the deception good night at parting bent above the sweet countenance of his mother in law and kissed her reverently on the forehead at which she drew him down and pressed her lips to his cheek declaring at the last moment that could not be in better hands than his and that he had her entire confidence and love here is purse and yours said colonel pressing it into gray s hand when they retired to be for a few minutes alone and here is a letter of credit that you will use at your discretion say nothing i pray you about this matter but consider yourself as i told you before one of my family and entitled to a full share of all i have i also want you to know that i like you more than i ever dreamed i should and that there has been a weight lifted from my heart since i have found to what a true man the happiness of my child is nothing was to be gained by any reply to this speech except a simple thank you colonel and an hour later the mail bore the wedded pair rapidly toward the channel gray was not surprised because his wife curled herself into a corner of the and wept softly during most of the journey she had enough to weep for god knew and tears he had often heard were a blessing to women in trouble the kindest thing was to arrange her about her with a gentle hand and leave her to herself at the steamer pier he assisted her to the ladies cabin glad to remember that the rules prevent men and women occupying that part of the boat together and gave special directions to the love gone astray with a good fee to make madame as comfortable as possible then he went into the men s cabin and lighting a cigar passed the time before reaching france in contemplating his future in wreaths of smoke when he went for his wife on the arrival of the steamer at he found that she had dried her tears for the in the experience of a new form of discomfort for which they offered no relief she had suffered from and presented a most spectacle as women are apt to do on such occasions she clung closer to her husband as he took her to the train and shivered as the wintry wind blew around the corners with a suggestion of fine snow in the air when the train started she began to talk referring to her illness on the boat and showing her feminine nature by remarks in relation to her appearance to which he gave suitable replies the was also occupied by another couple a young man and woman whom no one could doubt were on the first day of their wedding trip the young woman close to her husband and laughed when he tucked the about her feet and felt occasionally to see if her hands were as warm as they should be their conversation which did not for an instant was conducted in so low a tone that the man s lips almost and once or twice quite touched his companion s cheek happiness the purest and sweetest that is given to the children of men was theirs and the couple who sat in the other corner felt the contrast in all its intensity this girl thought might also be leaving good night her father and mother for the first time but in the overpowering love for her wedded mate she could feel her heart throb with joy even after that parting in the new arms to which she was going nature would teach her to forget for the those that had so long been her refuge against the breast of this lover she would find compensation for the one which had nursed her baby lips with this champion to fight her battles she could spare the father who had guarded her from every danger since her little feet took their first step and i reflected i what have i thrown away what have i gained in exchange for all

and enough money to keep her major is a good kind gentleman to take such trouble over the poor thing many another gentleman would have shut her up in a lunatic asylum smiled once more very significantly he quite believed that if could have shut up as a lunatic he would have done so long ago but in the first place it would be difficult to get two doctors to to her insanity and in the second if the case became known the use of the girl s money by might be questioned the major had just made sufficient of the story public to save himself from awkward questions and foresaw that to from her false position was a more difficult task than he had reckoned upon however notwithstanding that things looked thus black he held to his determination of having an explanation with major and as the evening was pleasant he walked to at his leisure there was more chance of catching the major at this hour since it was probable that he would always return to the maid for dinner as he was starting mrs came up to him at the door if you see major sir she said in a low voice you might tell him that mr has come back who is he asked forgetting what had said a small clever gentleman with a long beard who the sealed message looked after that poor girl for a time he went away to some foreign port months ago but returned to this neighborhood during the last two or three days i haven t seen

what had been said he then remembered how had called this dwarf by the name of and said that he had gone to apparently he had acted as a kind of companion to and possibly as a although he had not been allowed by to teach his pupil reading or writing it occurred to that the scholar was friendly to in that case he certainly would be hostile to her guardian as he could not fail to know from personal observation that the girl was perfectly sane and was detained the young man felt very certain that wished to see this mr not to ask him questions as to the reason for his sudden departure some months back but to bribe him into silence regarding the truth i shall hunt up thought as he mounted the rising road to he may be able to help and myself and heaven knows that we shall need all the help and friendship that we can obtain the evening was warm luminous and intensely still the message did not hurry himself but sauntered through the lovely country enjoying its beauty in spite of his anxious state of mind in the depths of his heart he felt that everything would come right in the end and that he would some day be able to make his dear wife they would then live happily ever afterwards just like a fairy tale still in fairy tales the lovers always have to undergo much woe and and danger before the end is reached and this of real life â as believed â was to proceed much on the same lines had to be overcome enchanted castles had to be but when these tasks laid upon the fated prince were accomplished he would awaken the princess to life with a kiss and all the would come to the the young man thought but there was a bitter truth in the and fairy tales themselves are only fanciful pictures of life s mystery pain must be undergone before pleasure can be gained was absent when the

stout the most noticeable thing about her was her eyes which were rather large being brown in color and shaded by very long lashes her hair was drawn back in what we learned many years later to call a knot dressed in a becoming light robe bound about her waist with a cord and cut low enough at the neck to display the outlines of a handsome throat she made a pretty picture as she turned the leaves

loves and no stranger who witnessed it could have doubted that the writer was to her the dearest person on earth for several minutes the picturesque figure remained leaning against the trunk of the tree like a lovely statue with the letter in her hand and her eyes on the ground in deep meditation but though the gaze was apparently fixed upon the grass at her feet the thoughts behind it were much further away a smile played about the ripe lips and an escaping lock of hair hung low over her forehead i hope mr s well ma am said tom at last despairing of finding any other way to attract bis mistress s attention a modern the lady looked up oh yes thank you tom he is very well indeed and he asks to be remembered to all of you the boy s face bore a pleased grin as he off to tell the news to
