I am an assistant professor of computer science at the [University of New Hampshire](https://ceps.unh.edu/computer-science). I did my PhD at the University of Michigan School of Information with [Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/) and [Paul Resnick](https://presnick.people.si.umich.edu/), where I was affiliated with the [Center for Social Media Responsibility](https://csmr.umich.edu/). I did postdoctoral work with [Chenhao Tan](https://www.chenhaot.com/) at University of Colorado Boulder and University of Chicago. 

My research is about human-centered NLP, with an emphasis on model interpretability as a means for achieving safer, more effective and ethical human-model collaboration when dealing with text. To that end, I am interested in both algorithmic and human-subjects work; both to create new methods for opening up models to human scrutiny, and running experiments to understand the human factors involved in that scrutiny.
